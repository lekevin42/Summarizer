b'Ichigo Kurosaki (\xe9\xbb\x92\xe5\xb4\x8e \xe4\xb8\x80\xe8\xad\xb7, Kurosaki Ichigo) is a Human who has Shinigami powers and is a Substitute Shinigami.'
b'Ichigo is the son of Isshin and Masaki Kurosaki, and older brother of Karin and Yuzu.@.'
b'He likes to wear slim fitting clothes.[6] He has a tendency to wear shirts patterned with the number 15 because his name is a homonym for the number.[7] Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin.[8] When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears the standard Shinigami attire, with the addition of a strap across his chest.'
b"Initially, it was a thick brown belt to hold his Zanpakut\xc5\x8d sheath, but it later became a red rosary-like strap after awakening his own Shinigami powers.[9] It is shaped like a kite with a flat top and bottom.[10] Ichigo's appearance has caused several people, including J\xc5\xabshir\xc5\x8d Ukitake, to note a similarity to Kaien Shiba, the former lieutenant of the 13th Division.[11] After training in the Dangai, Ichigo's hair grows considerably, and he is noticeably taller, as stated by his friends.[12] After Ichigo loses his Shinigami powers, his appearance reverts to the way it was before his Dangai training.[13]@."
b"Ichigo's new Shinigami uniform.@."
b"Ichigo's Shinigami attire consists of a thicker strap across his chest."
b'After training at the Soul King Palace, Ichigo wears his standard black shihakush\xc5\x8d, but with some notable changes: he has two white shoulder plates crossing his chest in an X shape that hold his Shikai blades in place, with the plate on his left shoulder having three sections adorned with red scales,[17] and a white cloak with black markings tied around his waist.[18]@.'
b'When he was younger, Ichigo considered his mother to be the center of his world, always smiling when he was with Masaki and regularly holding her hand.[19] Despite crying whenever he lost in a match at the dojo he attended, Ichigo started to smile again as soon as he saw Masaki when she came to pick him up.[20] At a very young age, Ichigo heard his father saying his name means "to protect one thing," which instilled in him a desire to protect his mother.'
b'As a teenager, Ichigo is stubborn, short-tempered, strong-willed, and impulsive.[24][25] Despite claiming not to care about what other people think about him, he attempts to maintain a detached and "cool" image.[26] He generally keeps his face set in a near-permanent scowl, with his eyebrows drawn together.[27] His outspoken, hot-headed demeanor is a trait Ichigo himself has acknowledged, and if somebody picks a fight with him, he cannot help fighting back.'
b'Ichigo is a capable student, ranked 23rd in his year at school, who studies regularly and does not neglect his schoolwork.[32] He works as hard as he does to overcome the misconceptions many have about him based on his hair color and fighting.[33] Ichigo hates fortune telling, horoscopes, feng shui, psychics, and anyone whose trade involves taking money from people for things they cannot see.[34] He has difficulty remembering people\'s faces and names.[35][36][37] Ichigo becomes extremely shy and uncomfortable around nude or immodestly dressed women, a fact both Yoruichi Shih\xc5\x8din and Rangiku Matsumoto have teased him for.[38][39][40] Ichigo is often disrespectful when talking to those older than himself, calling Genry\xc5\xabsai Shigekuni Yamamoto "gramps" and referring to several of the Shinigami captains by their given names without using honorifics.[41][42][43][44][45]@.'
b"When it comes to fighting, Ichigo has a complex sense of honor; he regularly seeks to exact revenge for the cruel actions of his opponent, such as instilling the fear of being murdered in Shrieker and cutting off the right arm of Yammy Llargo in retaliation for him ripping Yasutora Sado's right arm off.[46][47] He often taunts and belittles his opponents when fighting, sometimes attacking without warning.[48] Ichigo has a strong desire to win his fights, but in what he views as a legitimate manner.[49] To this end, he has often refused the aid of his inner Hollow, even when knowing it would allow him to win.[50] Ichigo's resolve in battle can waver at times, which can impede his fighting prowess, and goes into a state of depression and self-loathing when he loses a major battle or lets a friend down.[51]@."
b'Ichigo was born on July 15th as the son of Isshin Kurosaki and Masaki Kurosaki, 15 years before he became a Shinigami.'
b'Though Tatsuki beat Ichigo in every match they had, she would help Ichigo if he was being picked on by bullies and cheer him up if he was upset.[20]@.'
b'Unable to tell the difference between ghosts and living people, Ichigo ran towards her to stop her, unaware the girl was the lure of the Hollow Grand Fisher.'
b'During this time, Ichigo finally defeated Tatsuki in a karate match, and had not had another match with her since.[59] Ichigo regularly got into fights with thugs, due to the unusual color of his hair.[28] During one of these fights, he received help from Yasutora Sado.'
b'Shortly after, Ichigo returned the favor when he rescued Sado from two gang members roughing him up.[60] When the thugs later abducted Sado, Ichigo found them and knocked down their leader, Yokochini.'
b'Shortly before Ichigo became a Shinigami, he and Sado began attending Karakura High School, and their reputations preceded them.'
b'During a fight with a gang led by Reiichi \xc5\x8cshima, Ichigo and Sado met Keigo Asano and Mizuiro Kojima, saving the former in the process.'
b"While Keigo was initially afraid of Ichigo and Sado, both he and Mizuiro later became friends with them.[62] Ichigo later met Ury\xc5\xab Ishida, asking him why he chose to attend Karakura and not a gifted school, as he would have thought that Ury\xc5\xab would want to follow in his father's footsteps and become a doctor."
b"After scaring some skateboarders away from a dead girl's resting place, Ichigo, apologizing to her, promises to bring her some new flowers to replace those damaged by the skaters, telling her to go to heaven quickly.[64] That evening, Ichigo, seeing Rukia Kuchiki in his bedroom, initially mistakes her for a burglar, but when Ichigo realizes only he can see the intruder, he accepts Rukia is a ghost."
b"As a Hollow attacks the house, Ichigo, upon hearing his sister's pleas for help, breaks free and rushes to stop the Hollow.[65] Surprised at its monstrous appearance, Ichigo charges at it with a baseball bat in an attempt to release the captive Yuzu."
b"Rukia frees Yuzu, but Ichigo's reckless actions force Rukia to shield him with her body, severely injuring her."
b"Seeing Ichigo's determination to protect his family, Rukia offers to temporarily turn him into a Shinigami by piercing his chest with her Zanpakut\xc5\x8d and transferring half of her power to him."
b"Absorbing almost all of Rukia's power, Ichigo, making short work of the Hollow, collapses afterwards.[66][67]@."
b'Ichigo learns that Rukia is now his classmate.@.'
b"The following morning, Ichigo is horrified when he discovers Rukia is now a part of his class, and she has altered his family's memories of the attack."
b'When Ichigo refuses, Rukia, forcing his soul out of his body, takes him to a park where a Hollow is about to attack.'
b"She persuades Ichigo to perform her duties.[68] After undergoing some training with Rukia to improve his combat tactics, a Hollow bursts into his room.[69] Rukia, who has taken to staying in his closet, forces Ichigo's soul out of his body."
b"He cuts off part of the Hollow's mask, revealing it to be Sora Inoue.[70] Explaining the origins of Hollows, Rukia states Orihime Inoue is in danger, as Hollows often attack their relatives."
b"They rush to Orihime's apartment, where Ichigo manages to stop the Hollow before it eats Orihime's and Tatsuki's souls.[71]@."
b"Sora uses Ichigo's Zanpakut\xc5\x8d to purify himself.@."
b"At Orihime's apartment, Ichigo initially panics when he sees her soul separated from her body, but Rukia explains there is still time to save her."
b'Rukia explains to Ichigo Hollows defeated by a Zanpakut\xc5\x8d are purified and sent to Soul Society.'
b'As Ichigo and Orihime talk, Rukia, healing her, erases her memory of the event.[72]@.'
b"At school, Ichigo fends off Mizuiro Kojima's suggestions of a relationship with Rukia and Reiichi \xc5\x8cshima's threats about his hair color."
b'Ichigo notices Sado has a parakeet with him, and there is a spirit inside it.'
b'When Rukia confirms it is just a lonely Plus, which they should send to the Soul Society that night, Ichigo complains about missing another night of sleep.[73] Upon returning home, Ichigo helps with the injured from a car accident, among them Sado.'
b'Ichigo notes the wound on his back was inflicted by a Hollow.[74] The next morning, Ichigo tracks the spirit inside the parakeet using Reiraku in order to find Sado.[75] When they find Sado, he runs away from them.'
b'Ichigo arrives to take over fighting Shrieker.[78] When Rukia releases him from his body, he, injuring Shrieker, notices small creatures nearby, and is told they spit out explosive leeches.'
b"When the Hollow refuses to trigger them, Ichigo, ripping out its tongue, stabs his sword into Shrieker's leg.[79] Asking him how it feels to be unable to move or fight and if he can savor what it is like to be murdered, Ichigo cuts through his head, and Shrieker is pulled into Hell."
b'After Rukia explains about Hell, she tells the Plus they will send him to Soul Society, and Ichigo says he might see his mother there.[80]@.'
b"Unconvinced by the artificial soul's personality, Ichigo is forced to leave it in his body when they receive an order from Soul Society.[81] After defeating the Hollow, a concerned Ichigo, rushing back, sees his body jump out of an upstairs window and run away extremely fast."
b"As they chase after him, Rukia tells him it must be a Mod soul.[82] As Rukia explains what she means to an angry Ichigo, he, asking if Rukia is alright with the idea of the Mod Souls being created and killed all for Soul Society's convenience, wonders how the Mod Soul must feel about being persecuted and gaining his body.[83] Receiving a warning about a Hollow, they, hurrying to its location, find the Mod Soul is fighting it."
b"When Kisuke Urahara removes the Mod Soul from Ichigo's body, Ichigo, asking him what he is going to do with it, asks who he is."
b'When Rukia gives the Mod Soul to Ichigo, he thanks her for not throwing him away.[84]@.'
b'After failing to find a body to place the Mod Soul in, Ichigo, placing him in a plushie, decides to call him Kon.'
b'On the 16th of June, Ichigo, woken by Kon, scrambles to hide him and Rukia as Yuzu comes into the room to say Mizuiro is waiting for him.'
b'Apologizing to Mizuiro, he, noting his memory has been erased, remembers Rukia had told him Urahara must have worked hard.'
b"As Rukia leaves, Ichigo, complaining about Isshin not waking him up as usual, notices the date.[85] That night, the Kurosakis hold a family meeting to discuss their trip to Masaki's grave the following day."
b'Ichigo asks Rukia if he can take the day off from the Shinigami work, as it is the day Masaki was killed.[86]@.'
b"Annoyed that Rukia followed them, Ichigo, becoming angry when she asks if Masaki was killed by a Hollow, notices the same girl he saw the night Masaki died, and, running after her, tells Rukia he killed Masaki.[87] At Masaki's grave, Ichigo, watching his family's antics, reflects on his mother's death and its impact on his family.[88] Sensing the Reiatsu of a Hollow, Ichigo realizes the twins are easy targets.[89] As the Hollow attempts to eat Yuzu, Ichigo, arriving, cuts the twins free."
b'Demanding to know why the girl he saw when Masaki died is there, he asks if she is controlled by the Hollow.[90] When Rukia tells him the Hollow is called Grand Fisher and it uses the girl as a lure to trick and devour Humans who have high levels of spiritual power, Ichigo, realizing Grand Fisher killed his mother, lunges at it.'
b"Transforming his lure into an image of Masaki, Grand Fisher explains about his ability.[92][93] As he pierces Ichigo's chest, Ichigo, stabbing the Hollow's chest."
b'As Rukia tries to convince Ichigo he cannot fight him any more, he, insisting he can and the Hollow is still not dead yet, soon collapses.[95] Using most of her strength to heal his stomach wound, Rukia leaves his other injuries.'
b'When Ichigo awakens, in his Human body, in great pain, Rukia reminds him the wounds his soul receives will show up when he returns to his body.'
b'When Ichigo asks her if he lost, she tells him he won, since the Hollow fled and nobody died.'
b'Isshin gives Ichigo some advice.@.'
b"When Ichigo, at Masaki's grave, apologizes for not being able to avenge her, Isshin notes the time has gone by quickly, and it has already been ten years since Masaki died."
b'When Ichigo corrects his error, Isshin states he was "so close".'
b'When Ichigo loudly complains about this, Isshin says Masaki can rest easily if she sees him being so lively.'
b'Isshin explains he smokes on this one occasion, as the only time Masaki complimented his looks while they were dating is when she saw him smoking.[97] When Ichigo asks why nobody blames him for her death, Isshin, dismissing the suggestion, says Masaki would be mad at him, and she would gladly die to protect her child.'
b'Asking Rukia if her powers are returning, Ichigo asks her to allow him to remain a Shinigami for a while longer regardless.'
b"While Yuzu and Isshin are watching Don Kanonji's Ghost Bust TV program one Wednesday evening, Ichigo asks Karin why she is not watching it with them."
b'Remembering she saw the Hollow who attacked the house when he first met Rukia, Ichigo realizes she might be able to see Shinigami too.'
b"As Ichigo's friends all do the pose, Ichigo tells Keigo he is not going to the live recording of Ghost Bust at the abandoned hospital in Karakura, despite his attempts to convince him to go.[99] The following Wednesday, Ichigo accompanies his family to watch Ghost Bust being filmed."
b'When Orihime tells him he is so kind, Ichigo dismisses it as normal.[100]@.'
b'Surprised she is concerned about his health, Ichigo, asking if there really is a spirit in the hospital, says the Shinigami would have dealt with it already.'
b'Rukia says it is likely to be a Jibakurai, a soul on its way to becoming a Hollow.[101] When Ichigo asks Rukia if they should perform Kons\xc5\x8d on it to prevent it from becoming a Hollow, she says it takes months to turn into a Hollow.'
b"Urahara frees Ichigo's Shinigami form from his body, allowing him to knock Kanonji away from the Jibakurai."
b'As Ichigo realizes the medium can see him, the Jibakurai vanishes in an explosion.[103] As Kanonji promises to send Ichigo to heaven too, Rukia shouts at him to look up, where they see the spirit reforming into a Hollow on top of the hospital.'
b'As Ichigo and Kanonji bicker, the Hollow charges at them.'
b'Ichigo fends off its attack, and when the Hollow gets its head stuck in a wall, Ichigo drags Kanonji inside.[104][105]@.'
b"When the Hollow attacks again, Ichigo's Zanpakut\xc5\x8d becomes stuck in the ceiling."
b"When the Hollow glues Ichigo's hands together, Kanonji, jamming its mouth open with his staff, frees Ichigo's blade.[106] When Ichigo's sword becomes embedded in the Hollow's shoulder, it drags him up to the roof."
b'The following day, Rukia helps Ichigo and his friends get out of trouble for their actions at the abandoned hospital when they are brought before the principal and Kagine, who states their escapades were broadcast live nationwide.[109] That afternoon, Ichigo, answering the door, meets Don Kanonji.'
b'When Kanonji reveals he invited Rukia along, Ichigo realizes it was her who told him where he lived.'
b'After numerous incidents of arriving at the supposed site of a Hollow attack, only to find there is no Hollow, Ichigo and Rukia bicker.'
b'When Ichigo asks if there is another Shinigami defeating the Hollows before him, Rukia tells him Shinigami are strictly sorted, and it should not be the case.[111] Ichigo tries to keep away from Rukia at school to avoid the rumors since their appearance on Ghost Bust.'
b'Rukia drags Ichigo off, prompting him to complain about the rumors regarding them.'
b'When she tells him to complain later, as there is a Hollow, Ichigo tells her he will not forgive her if it is not there this time, but they find nothing.[112] After another incident following school, Ichigo tells Rukia to do something about the problem as she drags his body from its hiding place.'
b'The pair are approached by Ury\xc5\xab Ishida, who asks Ichigo if it is correct he can see spirits, which Ichigo denies is even possible.'
b'When a new Hollow appears, Ury\xc5\xab, killing it, introduces himself, saying he hates Shinigami and Ichigo.[113][114]@.'
b"Ury\xc5\xab grabs Ichigo's red spirit thread.@."
b'At school, Ichigo, reflecting upon his encounter with Ury\xc5\xab, wonders why he would say such things to a complete stranger and why Ury\xc5\xab was angry.'
b'When Orihime asks what happened between Ichigo and Ury\xc5\xab, Ichigo dismisses it as no big deal.[115] After school, Ichigo follows Ury\xc5\xab as he leaves.'
b"When Ichigo applauds him, Ury\xc5\xab states it is due to Ichigo's inability to restrain his spiritual power, and he lacks the ability to sense Reiatsu, as evidenced by him not noticing Ury\xc5\xab until that day."
b"Revealing he noticed Ichigo's unusually high spiritual power and his acquisition of Shinigami powers, Ury\xc5\xab, inviting Ichigo to fight him, says Shinigami are unnecessary in the Human World.[116]@."
b'Though Ichigo ridicules the idea, Ury\xc5\xab succeeds in convincing him to fight him, and he uses Kon to free his Shinigami form.'
b'Using some Hollow bait to cause Hollows to gather in Karakura Town, Ury\xc5\xab states the one who defeats the most Hollows within twenty-four hours wins.'
b"When Ichigo, angered by this, demands to know why he is exposing the town's residents to such danger, Ury\xc5\xab tells him not to worry, as they will kill all the Hollows.[117] As Ichigo tries to make him undo it, Ury\xc5\xab tells him Hollows will soon flood the town, and he should try to protect as many people as possible."
b"When Ury\xc5\xab tells him Hollows tend to prefer people with high spiritual power, Ichigo runs off to find Karin.[118] After slaying his third Hollow and saving a pair of Pluses, Ichigo, struggling to remember where Karin is, sends Kon to get Rukia's Denreishinki to aid in reacting to the Hollows.[119] Defeating the Hollows between the Kurosaki Clinic and the last place where he saw Karin, Ichigo thinks it should be safe for her now.[120]@."
b'Unable to attract their attention by shouting, Ury\xc5\xab fires an arrow at Ichigo, who, blocking it, insists it is a battle between him and Ury\xc5\xab, and the amount of Hollows they beat is irrelevant.'
b'As Kon points out there is a large crack forming in the sky, and Ury\xc5\xab begins firing arrows into the group of Hollows, Ichigo tells him there are too many, and they need to come up with a strategy.'
b'When Rukia explains the fall of the Quincy at the hands of the Shinigami, Ichigo, running after Ury\xc5\xab, attacks several Hollows around him.[121][122] When Ichigo, telling Ury\xc5\xab he does not know or care about whether the Shinigami or Quincy were right, expresses frustration at his methods, Ury\xc5\xab tells him he thought the Shinigami were correct until his sensei was killed in front of him.'
b"Telling Ichigo of his sensei's attempts to convince the Shinigami to work together with the remaining Quincy and how he died fighting a group of huge Hollows without achieving that goal, Ury\xc5\xab says he must prove the strength of the Quincy to the Shinigami."
b'As Ururu Tsumugiya, Tessai Tsukabishi, Jinta Hanakari, and Urahara arrive to fight the Hollows, Urahara tells Ichigo to concentrate on fighting the Menos.[124] Seeing its size, Ichigo, questioning if it is in fact a Hollow, is shocked to see it eating the nearby Hollows.'
b"Noticing Ichigo's power flows into his bow when he touches it, Ury\xc5\xab, planning to fire an enlarged arrow at the Menos, tells Ichigo to increase his power to maximum."
b'His power increasing as he resists the Cero, Ichigo repels the attack, injuring the Menos in the process.[126] As the Menos retreats, Ichigo, claiming victory, collapses as his Zanpakut\xc5\x8d begins to destabilize.'
b"Ury\xc5\xab tells him to make sure he lives so he can beat him later.[127] The following day, when Rukia tells Ichigo not to pay attention to Ury\xc5\xab's injuries, Ichigo denies being worried."
b'Later, when he overhears Keigo telling Mizuiro he saw Ury\xc5\xab talking to himself the previous day, believing it to be related to a theater, Ichigo is thankful Keigo is an idiot.'
b'Asking Ury\xc5\xab to join them for lunch, Ichigo later regrets it, due to the atmosphere which prevails over their meal.[128]@.'
b'That night, Ichigo, taking the leftovers from dinner to give to Rukia, finds she is gone.[129] At 2:00 a.m., Ichigo, wondering whether she is going to return that night, notes it would be nice not to have Shinigami duties to carry out for once.'
b'When Ichigo asks why he was tied up, Kon, saying Rukia is in big trouble, shows Ichigo a note she left on his desk.'
b'Confused by the message, which tells them she has to leave and they should go into hiding instead of looking for her, Ichigo decides to change into his Shinigami form and find her.'
b'Appearing at the window, Urahara changes him into his Shinigami form.[130]@.'
b"As Lieutenant Renji Abarai attacks Rukia, Ichigo, arriving, attacks him.[131] When Renji notes the size of Ichigo's Zanpakut\xc5\x8d, Ichigo replies he thought it was large compared to Rukia's, but there had not been anyone else to compare it to."
b"Realizing he is the Human who took Rukia's Shinigami powers, Renji, attacking him, asks Ichigo what the name of his Zanpakut\xc5\x8d is."
b'When Ichigo, stating he has not named his sword, asks if they actually give them names, Renji activates his Shikai, surprising Ichigo with the change of form of his Zanpakut\xc5\x8d.'
b"Ichigo's final blow to Renji is stopped.@."
b"As Renji, explaining about the Shikai form of Zanpakut\xc5\x8d, moves to attack him, Rukia attempts to stop him so Ichigo can flee, but Ichigo's Reiatsu increases, and he, injuring the surprised Renji, quickly overwhelms him."
b"As Ichigo attempts to end the fight, Byakuya severs his sword's tip, leaving Ichigo stunned."
b"As he prepares for Byakuya's subsequent attack, Byakuya, appearing behind him, stabs him.[133] Falling to the ground, Ichigo, wondering whether he was attacked from the front or from behind, is stabbed again by Byakuya.[134] As Byakuya and Rukia talk about Ichigo, he, grabbing Byakuya's leg, tells him not to talk about him as if he is dead."
b'As Byakuya tells him to let go, Ichigo instructs the captain to look at him when he is talking so he can hear him.'
b"Kicking Ichigo's hand away from her brother, Rukia, telling him he should know his place, tells Byakuya she is ready to leave."
b'As Ichigo protests, Renji tells him to stop making things worse.'
b'When Rukia tells Byakuya there is no point in deliberately killing Ichigo, as he will soon stop breathing on his own, Ichigo asks if this is a joke, prompting Rukia to state if he tries to follow her, she will never forgive him.'
b"As she tells him to conserve what energy he has left so he may live a moment longer, Byakuya, acquiescing to Rukia's request, states Ichigo should die shortly due to his injuries, but if he does survive, he will no longer possess any Shinigami powers."
b'As they leave, Ichigo, noting he cannot move or speak, reflects upon how he came to protect Rukia, but instead she protected him again.[135] As Ichigo contemplates his injuries in the rain, Urahara approaches him.[136]@.'
b"When Ichigo awakens in Urahara's shop, Urahara tells him his wounds are not yet fully healed, and if he moves too much, he may die."
b"When Ichigo asks him about Ury\xc5\xab's condition, Urahara states Ury\xc5\xab's injuries were treated on the spot, and when he left, he was worried about Ichigo, stating Ichigo was the only one who could beat the Shinigami and save Rukia."
b'When Ichigo says he cannot do anything, as Rukia has been taken to Soul Society and he cannot follow, Urahara reveals he can send Ichigo there if he trains with Urahara for the next ten days, revealing Soul Society typically allows a grace period of one month before executions.'
b'Saying Ichigo will die if he goes there in his current condition, he reveals he purposely allowed Ichigo to fight Renji and Byakuya so he would realize this after having fought them himself.'
b'He states it will take seven days to open the gate to Soul Society, leaving Ichigo with thirteen days in Soul Society to rescue Rukia.'
b"Orihime asks Ichigo about Rukia's disappearance.@."
b"As he walks home after dismissing Keigo's invitation to spend the holiday with him, he meets Orihime, who, asking him where Rukia is, notes everyone has forgotten about her, but she believed Ichigo would know."
b'Explaining the situation to her, Ichigo is surprised she can see his Shinigami form.'
b'Thanking her, Ichigo, going to the Urahara Shop, shows Urahara his healed wounds.'
b"Telling Urahara he told Isshin he would be sleeping over at a friend's house, he asks Urahara to teach him well.[138]@."
b'Urahara reveals Byakuya destroyed the source of his power, leaving him without any Shinigami powers, and he must restore these in order to fight the Shinigami.'
b'Urahara has Ururu Tsumugiya attack Ichigo, and she lunges at him, creating a large cloud of dust and debris.[139] Emerging from the dust, Ichigo runs away from Ururu after another near miss.'
b'Congratulating him on clearing the lesson, Urahara asks if Ichigo is still having trouble breathing or moving, which he is not.'
b"As Urahara says he has successfully recovered his spirit energy, and the soul tends to gain the Reiryoku faster when it is in danger of being destroyed, Tessai, cutting Ichigo's Chain of Fate, pins him to the ground.[141] Telling him the chain has already begun to corrode from the severed end, Urahara states if it reaches his chest, Ichigo will become a Hollow, but he can avoid this by becoming a Shinigami instead."
b'The point of this lesson, which Urahara calls "Shattered Shaft," is to restore Ichigo\'s Shinigami powers.'
b'Dropped to the bottom of a shaft, he is bound with a Kin spell, and Urahara tells him to scale the vertical sides of the deep shaft.[142] Revealing there is a gas at the bottom of the shaft which speeds up the corrosion process to at most 72 hours, he tells Ichigo to become a Shinigami and climb out of the hole before that, or else he will become a Hollow, and they will destroy him.[143]@.'
b"As the remaining length of the chain begins to corrode, a hole opens in Ichigo's chest, and a mask begins to form over his face.[144] Urahara explains the mask forming before his body reforms shows Ichigo is resisting the transformation.[145]@."
b'Surprised that Ichigo does not recognize him, the man says his name, but Ichigo cannot hear it.'
b'When Ichigo falls from the building, the man, following him, states he should not worry, as Shinigami control death.'
b'As Ichigo tells him he is not currently a Shinigami, the man, telling him to focus the Reishi around him underneath his feet to stand on, urges Ichigo to remember a time when he stopped in mid-air as a Shinigami.'
b"He tells Ichigo Byakuya destroyed the powers given to him by Rukia, but Ichigo has his own Shinigami powers, which were hidden deep in his soul and awakened by Rukia's power."
b"Remembering Ury\xc5\xab stating Shinigami have red Reiraku, he uses this to find a box containing a Zanpakut\xc5\x8d's hilt."
b'Telling him this time he ought to hear his name, the man urges him to take the hilt.[147] As Ichigo struggles to pull out the Zanpakut\xc5\x8d, back in the shaft, the Kid\xc5\x8d restraining Ichigo breaks apart.'
b'As the smoke clears, Ichigo, wearing a Hollow mask and Shinigami clothes, uses his still broken Zanpakut\xc5\x8d to smash the Hollow mask.'
b"Having sworn to kill Urahara when he got out of the shaft, Ichigo hits him in the eye with the sword's hilt."
b'As Ichigo proposes a five minute time limit, Urahara draws a blade from within his cane.[148]@.'
b'Ichigo and Kisuke Urahara clash.@.'
b"Overwhelming Ichigo, Urahara, revealing his sword is a Zanpakut\xc5\x8d, activates Benihime's Shikai.[149] As Ichigo remembers Renji using his Shikai during their fight, Urahara, telling him every Zanpakut\xc5\x8d has a name, cuts through the remains of Ichigo's blade until just the hilt remains, saying if he continues to fight with just the hilt, he will kill him."
b'As Ichigo, thinking he is going to die, runs away, Urahara continues to attack him.'
b'Ichigo sees the man from his inner world again, who, asking why Ichigo ran when he has not yet called him, reveals his name is Zangetsu.[150] Stopping in his tracks, Ichigo, turning towards Urahara, calls out Zangetsu, activating his Shikai.'
b'Looking at the new form of his Zanpakut\xc5\x8d, Ichigo, telling Urahara he might not be able to hold back, swings Zangetsu at him, who uses Chikasumi no Tate.'
b"After completing Urahara's training, Ichigo has a relatively normal summer holiday while waiting for the gate to Soul Society to be opened."
b'Isshin and the twins, running up to Ichigo, knock him down a bank.'
b'When Ichigo asks if they are drunk, Isshin reveals a juice seller used wine to dilute their juice instead of water.'
b"Telling the group they saved a seat on the opposite bank of the river that morning, Isshin heads off with the girls and several of Ichigo's friends.[152] Later that night, after complaining to a drunken Isshin about having to carry his sisters, Ichigo tells him he will be leaving soon, and he might not be back until the summer vacation ends.[153]@."
b'Isshin presents Ichigo with a protective charm.@.'
b'Seven days after completing his training, Ichigo is summoned to the Urahara Shop.'
b'Revealing he did not know she was going until Urahara mentioned it, Ichigo asks her if she is sure about it.'
b'When they arrive at the shop, they find Sado waiting for them, and Ichigo, asking where Ury\xc5\xab is, says he had heard he was coming too.'
b'When Ury\xc5\xab, arriving in a Quincy outfit, promises to show Ichigo how powerful he has become, Ichigo criticizes him for walking the entire way there wearing that outfit.'
b"In the underground training area, Urahara, revealing the Senkaimon they will be using to enter Soul Society, removes Ichigo's Shinigami form from his body."

b"While Ichigo is distracted by Byakuya, Senbonzakura, reappearing, launches Ichigo into Ashisogi Jiz\xc5\x8d's path."
b'Minazuki draws Ichigo in to the path of Kazeshini, and, after a short struggle, Ichigo, striking down the Zanpakut\xc5\x8d, finds Yamamoto inside a barrier.[333] Before Ichigo can do anything, Muramasa, attacking him, coerces Ichigo into using his full power.'
b'After several failed attempts to escape, Ichigo, freed by the arrival of Captain Hitsugaya, heads to the Human World, where he confronts Muramasa, who has just completed the release of K\xc5\x8dga.[335] Surprised at how powerful K\xc5\x8dga is after being sealed for so long, Ichigo, shocked to see K\xc5\x8dga stab Muramasa, listens as he explains his motive for doing so.'
b'Ichigo protects Rukia and Orihime from the transformed Muramasa.@.'
b"Understanding Byakuya was trying to restore his family's honor, Ichigo tells him to concentrate on K\xc5\x8dga while he deals with the Hollows.[337] As the amount of Hollows keeps increasing, Muramasa, absorbing all nearby Hollows, becomes a Hollow himself."
b"After he is defeated by Ichigo, he transforms into a huge dome-like creature which engulfs Ichigo as it grows.[338] Ichigo finds himself inside K\xc5\x8dga's inner world, where he defeats the ailing Muramasa."
b'After he escapes from the dome, Muramasa dies, and Byakuya sincerely thanks Ichigo for his efforts.[339]@.'
b'In the Human World, after Ichigo briefly encounters a T\xc5\x8dj\xc5\xab, which escapes, Hitsugaya tells Ichigo and Urahara about the current situation in Soul Society.'
b'After the T\xc5\x8dj\xc5\xab is absorbed by a Hollow and the two fuse together, Ichigo, saving Haineko from it, battles the creature, which Zangetsu reveals is the same T\xc5\x8dj\xc5\xab from before.'
b'When Ichigo is thrown back by a Cero, Hitsugaya defeats it with his Shikai.[340] Later, Ichigo encounters Renji and Zabimaru.'
b"One month after Aizen's defeat, Ichigo continues his duties as a Substitute Shinigami, with Rukia remaining in Karakura Town."
b'When new orders are received for Rukia to bring Ichigo before the SRDI, she is unable to contact them again.'
b'When they go to Urahara for help, they learn Yoruichi went to Soul Society three days previously and has not been heard from since, despite her intending to return immediately.'
b'Urahara advises Ichigo against traveling there, as his Shinigami powers will eventually fade away, and overexerting himself will quicken their loss.'
b'Ichigo and Rukia travel to Soul Society regardless, and while passing through the Dangai, they are chased by the K\xc5\x8dtotsu.'
b'Upon arriving in Soul Society, Ichigo, feeling faint, falls to the ground, where he is arrested by the Gotei 13 as a material witness.[342]@.'
b'Ichigo and Rukia are caught by very convincing Reigai fakes.@.'
b'When hey are attacked by Renji and Ikkaku, their fight is brought to a close by Yoruichi, who seals Renji and Ikkaku with Kid\xc5\x8d.'
b'As the three escape, Ichigo comments upon the strange behavior of Renji and Ikkaku.'
b"Stating they were not the real Renji and Ikkaku, Yoruichi, revealing they were Reigai, tells Ichigo she has no idea how many Reigai have infiltrated the Gotei 13, but speculates the 12th Division's SRDI may have something to do with it."
b'Going to the 12th Division barracks, Ichigo and Rukia come across information regarding Nozomi, who was present in the Dangai.[343]@.'
b'When Ichigo shatters the gate with a Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d, they almost make it through, but Yoruichi is flung back by Reigai-Byakuya Kuchiki.'
b'Making a stand against the Reigai, Yoruichi gives Ichigo and Rukia time to escape to the Human World, where Ichigo saves Orihime from the mastermind behind the Reigai incident, Kager\xc5\x8dza Inaba.'
b"After a short skirmish, where Ichigo's powers fluctuate due to him overexerting himself, the real members of the Gotei 13, arriving, save Ichigo from Inaba, who flees.[344]@."
b'Ichigo assists in defending of Nozomi and Kon from an attacking Reigai.[345] Later, when Nozomi runs away, Ichigo is among the group which searches for her.[346] After separating from the group, he finds Nozomi attempting to seal herself away permanently in the Dangai, only to be stopped by several Reigai.'
b'After a run-in with a Reigai, Ichigo, Kon, and Nozomi arrive at the Urahara Shop, where Ichigo, inquiring about the state of the injured Shinigami, asks Tessai to take a look at Nozomi.'
b'Angrily dismissing this, Ichigo asks why Kenpachi has not left for Soul Society yet.'
b'When Kenpachi, saying he is leaving now, refuses to allow Ichigo to accompany him, Ichigo tells Kenpachi not to die, prompting him and Yachiru to reassure him he will not die before he fights Ichigo again.[348]@.'
b'After Urahara reveals the captains have safely made it to Soul Society, Ichigo, pleading with Urahara to send him too, says he cannot sit idly by.'
b'After their conversation, Nozomi, healing Ichigo with Kid\xc5\x8d, restores some of his Reiatsu before collapsing.'
b'Helping her up, Ichigo asks once more to go to Soul Society, thinking it best to take the fight to them before his powers fade altogether.'
b'Arriving in Soul Society, Ichigo, noticing he is not where he is supposed to be, spots Inaba and, attacking, questions Inaba about many things before Inaba, backing off, says he summoned Ichigo there by tweaking the Dangai so he could erase his existence.'
b'Using his Shikai to envelop him in a portal, Inaba says Ichigo should not exist, as he is not Human, nor is he is pure Shinigami or Hollow.'
b'As he calls Ichigo an anomaly, saying since he cannot create a Reigai of him he is getting rid of a variable, Ichigo, swallowed by the portal, is trapped inside the Dangai.[350]@.'
b'Ichigo reaches up to grab their hand, but is too far away.[351] Later, Urahara and Renji find Ichigo.'
b'As he wakes up in the Urahara Shop, Ichigo finds his friends sitting before him.'
b'When he asks Renji if he had rescued him from the Dangai, Renji says he had not, leaving Ichigo to wonder who it could have been.'
b'Ichigo invites Ury\xc5\xab to dinner after being saved by him.@.'
b'Some time after introducing Nozomi to his family using a cover story, Ichigo, encountering a Hollow, is unable to transform himself into his Shinigami form, and so evades the Hollow until Ury\xc5\xab kills it.'
b"As Nozomi's powers are debated, Ichigo suggests that if her Zanpakut\xc5\x8d is dormant, then they should awaken it."
b"Activating his Bankai, Ichigo fires a Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d at Nozomi, who, attempting to block it, successfully activates her Zanpakut\xc5\x8d's Shikai in the process."
b'When Nozomi rushes off to help the others fight against the newly-arrived Reigai, Ichigo pursues her.[354] Ichigo catches up to an exhausted Nozomi, who has seemingly defeated Reigai-Kenpachi.'
b"When they are found by several Reigai, Ichigo, with his fluctuating Reiatsu continuing to impair him, agrees to rely on Nozomi's Zanpakut\xc5\x8d."
b'Ichigo, his friends, and the Shinigami all direct their attacks on her, allowing her to absorb the power and release a powerful blast which defeats most of the Reigai, with Yamamoto finishing off the sole survivor.[355]@.'
b'As Ichigo and Rukia attempt to convince Yamamoto to accept Nozomi as an ally, they are attacked by two powerful Reigai.'
b'After awakening to find an unconscious Yamamoto, Ichigo joins Renji and Rukia in defending him.'
b'As Nozomi escapes and is pursued by Inaba, Ichigo, following, finds them and gathers his remaining strength for a Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d, which annihilates a duplicate of Inaba.'
b"When Ichigo recalls how Inaba repeatedly used the K\xc5\x8dtotsu on him, Urahara speculates that by obtaining Ichigo's remaining Reishi swallowed by the K\xc5\x8dtotsu, they can restore his powers."
b'Urahara reveals because Ichigo has no Reiatsu, he can move freely through the Dangai.'
b'Surmising it was Ichigo from the past, Urahara realizes the present-day Ichigo saved himself during his previous encounter with the K\xc5\x8dtotsu.'
b'Urahara warns Ichigo of the dangers to his soul.@.'
b'Urahara brings Ichigo and Kon to the natural Senkaimon which Nozomi previously attempted to use to seal herself in the Dangai.'
b"Upon arriving in Soul Society, they, sneaking into the SRDI, find Inaba's lab, the technology of which Urahara uses to restore Ichigo's Reishi in the form of a Mod Soul pill."
b'The process is incomplete, leaving his Reiatsu very weak and causing his inner Hollow to start growing out of control.'
b"Ichigo, Urahara, and Kon are able to escape, but Ichigo's inner Hollow begins to act up again, leading Urahara and Kon to insist he stay behind to be safe."
b'After Ichigo half-heartedly agrees, Urahara makes an extra precaution of binding Ichigo with a Kin spell, but Ichigo, transforming into a Hollow, breaks free.[360] As he rampages through the area, several Shinigami, finding him, attempt to subdue him, only for Ichigo to easily overwhelm them.'
b"As Yushima prepares to finish him off, Rukia forces him back, and Ichigo's other friends arrive."
b'As Yushima moves to kill Rukia, the Hollowfied Ichigo blocks the attack with his body.[362] As Ichigo, gaining control of himself, loses the rest of his Reiatsu, he realizes Nozomi is still alive inside Yushima.'
b'When Yushima regains control, the pair mock each other until Kon, posing as a Reigai bringing medicine to Inaba, kicks him back and gives Ichigo a complete Mod Soul pill of his Reishi, restoring his Shinigami powers and manifesting Zangetsu.'
b"As the two begin fighting evenly, Ichigo's friends join in the fight, and Ichigo, finding an opening, exploits it by using his Hollow mask."
b'Re-emerging, Nozomi begs Ichigo to finish her and Yushima off, but Ichigo still hesitates.'
b'When Kon tells Ichigo to strike for her Soul Chain to break the fusion, Ichigo attacks, but Yushima, regaining control, blocks and activates his Renzan Hajokuri technique to destroy all of Soul Society.'
b"As Ichigo's Reiatsu weakens, he deactivates his Bankai."
b"After Inaba dies, Nozomi begins to vanish as well, having earlier stabbed Yushima's body with a Reishi blade.[364] Later, Ichigo, given back his Shinigami badge, returns home with his friends.[365]@."
b"Days later, Ichigo's Reiatsu falters again, and he becomes so weak he struggles against low-level Hollows and cannot to perform Shunpo."
b'While knowing his powers are nearing the limit, Ichigo calmly continues his duties as a Substitute Shinigami and daily life as normal.'
b'One night, while struggling to fight a huge Hollow, Ichigo, realizing he is beyond his limit, summons his remaining strength to launch a Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d, which, destroying the Hollow, overtaxes Ichigo, causing him to faint.'
b'Revealing he knew Rukia was ordered to prevent him from fighting any longer, Ichigo realizes he cannot feel the presence of anything.'
b'As Rukia begins to fade from his sight, Ichigo, telling her to give everybody his regards, thanks her before she completely disappears.[366]@.'
b'At school, Ichigo, finding his Substitute Shinigami Badge in his bag, notes it has lost its abilities.'
b'Noticing Ury\xc5\xab running out of the classroom, aware he took over the Hollow extermination he used to cover, he notes to himself it is probably better for Ury\xc5\xab to handle it than Zennosuke Kurumadani.[367] At lunch, Keigo and Ichigo discuss future careers.'
b"When Keigo mentions Ichigo's grades were good when he began high school, but started slipping during the second half of his first year, Ichigo states he still did well despite the interference of his Shinigami duties."
b'Returning the stolen property to its owner, K\xc5\xabgo Ginj\xc5\x8d, Ichigo asks for him to keep his actions a secret.[369] The next day, Ichigo has a dream in which he sees silhouettes of Renji, Byakuya and Rukia telling him to wake up.'
b'When he awakens to the sound of Isshin, who pounces on him, Ichigo dodges, sending Isshin through an open window.'
b"Dismissing Isshin's complaints, Ichigo says he would go to Soul Society if he died."
b'Ichigo and Ury\xc5\xab punch Obuta together.@.'
b'When the gang leader demands Ichigo come forth, Ury\xc5\xab confronts the group, prompting Ichigo to rush to him to prevent the incident from worsening.[371] The two bicker at one another as they beat up the gang members.'
b'When K\xc5\xabgo enters the store, Ichigo recognizes him as the man whose bag he recovered.[373] When Ichigo asks what he wants from him, K\xc5\xabgo, showing him a picture of Isshin, asks for background information on him.'
b'Ichigo says Isshin is his father, and he can tell him anything he wants to know.'
b'Questioning whether Ichigo even knows enough to answer, K\xc5\xabgo says he should not even know about his family yet.[374] When Ichigo tries to ask him what he means, Ikumi, interrupting, says she is closing shop for the day and will consider the job.'
b'As he leaves, K\xc5\xabgo tells Ichigo to go to the Urahara Shop.[375]@.'
b'The card given to Ichigo by K\xc5\xabgo Ginj\xc5\x8d.@.'
b'K\xc5\xabgo approaches, calling Urahara a shady character.'
b'As Ichigo tries to defend Urahara, K\xc5\xabgo, questioning how much he knows about Urahara, warns him to act quickly to defend his family.[376] Telling K\xc5\xabgo he does not trust him, Ichigo is given a business card.'
b'When she tells him he is not there, Ichigo, going up to his room, states he could find Isshin if he still had his Shinigami powers.'
b'Visiting with some leftover bread from her job, Orihime asks him if something happened recently or if he is being followed, which Ichigo denies.[377]@.'
b'Ichigo and Orihime visit Ury\xc5\xab in the hospital.@.'
b'At dinnertime, Ichigo, rushing to Karakura Hospital, looking for the injured Ury\xc5\xab, finds Orihime is already there.'
b'When he asks where Sado is, Orihime tells him he did not answer when he was called.'
b'After Ury\xc5\xab states it had nothing to do with him, Ichigo offers to walk Orihime home, but Ry\xc5\xabken, deciding to drive her home instead, tells Ichigo he should get home as well.'
b'When he dials the number on the card K\xc5\xabgo gave him, a voice welcomes him to "Xcution."[378] Ichigo is given a complex dialing sequence to follow, which puts him through to K\xc5\xabgo.'
b'After Ichigo complains about the complicated nature of the phone call, K\xc5\xabgo arranges a meeting on the following evening at an address in Naruki City.'
b"The following day, when Orihime asks Ichigo if he knew what happened to Sado, who is absent from school, Ichigo, stating he does not know, declines an offer to go to Sado's house with her.[379]@."
b'When K\xc5\xabgo asks if Ichigo trusts him, Ichigo says he is probably not a normal Human.'
b'Giving a vague answer, K\xc5\xabgo notes Ichigo has nobody else to count on.'
b"As they enter Xcution's hideout, where Ichigo sees some of the other members of the group, K\xc5\xabgo reveals they aim to restore his Shinigami powers.[380] When Ichigo demands to know how and why they intend to do this, K\xc5\xabgo, insisting on taking their time, reveals the members of Xcution are Fullbringers, demonstrating their abilities."
b'When a complaining Riruka Dokugamine enters the room, Ichigo asks K\xc5\xabgo who she is.'
b"Ichigo and Sado in Xcution's hideout.@."
b'When Ichigo angrily asks Sado why he is there and why he has not been going to school, K\xc5\xabgo tells him to calm down so he can explain everything.'
b'As Ichigo glares at him, K\xc5\xabgo reveals a Fullbringer is a person who had a parent who was attacked by a Hollow before their birth.'
b'These powers are more like Hollow than Shinigami powers.'
b'He further explains Fullbringers do not enjoy their powers, similar to the way Ichigo hated his Hollow powers.'
b'K\xc5\xabgo says he wants to erase his powers, and they have learned they can pass their powers on to someone who possesses both Human and Shinigami powers.'
b'Ichigo realizes he was not the first person born from a Shinigami and a Human.[382]@.'
b'K\xc5\xabgo says they have old allies who have reverted to being Human, and they will help Ichigo get his Shinigami powers back so he can help them become normal Humans.'
b'He explains Sado offered to help them because it meant Ichigo getting his powers back.'
b'Asking Sado to confirm this, Ichigo listens as he explains he sees the pain Ichigo feels at not being able to protect the people he cares about.'
b'When K\xc5\xabgo says they will restore his Shinigami powers and add their own powers on top of that, Ichigo accepts this deal.[383]@.'
b"Shrugging off Riruka's complaints, Ichigo, saying he does not even understand the situation yet, asks how this will help him regain his Shinigami powers, and how he can suddenly use a power he has never used before."
b'After giving a brief explanation of Fullbring, Riruka leaves Ichigo, who, reflecting on what she said, thinks about how K\xc5\xabgo transformed his pendant into a sword, concluding he should focus on something he regularly has with him.'
b'Arriving, Sado tells Ichigo to use his Substitute Shinigami Badge.'
b'Ichigo unleashes a Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d-like attack to defeat Mr.'
b'Sado tells Ichigo it was pride which allowed him to use his Fullbring.'
b"When Ichigo thinks of times he was proud to be a Shinigami, his badge begins to take the form of Tensa Zangetsu's tsuba.[386] When K\xc5\xabgo explains the badge recorded every battle Ichigo ever fought, a shocked Ichigo, testing out a variety of ways to use this new power, successfully launches a large amount of energy shaped like a manji at Mr."
b"Ichigo wonders if the power will help him get his Shinigami powers back.[387] At Ichigo's behest, Riruka restores him to his normal size."
b"As Sado and Ichigo walk to Sado's home, the latter tells Ichigo Orihime has been bringing him leftover bread everyday lately."
b'As Sado goes to give half of it to Ichigo, he, noticing something wrong with her Reiatsu, states something has happened to her.[389]@.'
b"Sado and Ichigo rush to Orihime's side.@."
b'When Ichigo tries to call Orihime, Sado tells him not to, as it could distract her and lead her to her death.'
b"He says he cannot quite locate Orihime's exact location, but Ichigo can tell by the direction they are going she is at her apartment.[390] Arriving to find Orihime kneeling in front of her door, they ask her if she is alright."
b'Grabbing her shoulder, seeming distracted, Orihime, noticing Sado and Ichigo, asks why they are there.'
b'As they leave, Ichigo asks Sado about Orihime.'
b'Stating he was probably sensing things wrong, Sado tells Ichigo not to worry.[391]@.'
b'Realizing Sado and Orihime will not tell him anything, Ichigo, going to the Xcution hideout, explains the situation, telling them he believes Orihime was attacked by the same person who attacked Ury\xc5\xab.'
b'When K\xc5\xabgo and Jackie Tristan both suspect it is Sh\xc5\xabkur\xc5\x8d Tsukishima, Ichigo asks who this is, and K\xc5\xabgo reveals Tsukishima is a Fullbringer and the former leader of Xcution, who came up with the idea to give their powers to a Substitute Shinigami.[392] When they did so, he, killing the Shinigami and those who gave him their power, disappeared.'
b'Showing Ichigo a Substitute Shinigami Badge, he tells him he believes Tsukishima wants to keep Ichigo away from them, and is using his attacks on Ury\xc5\xab and Orihime to get his attention.'
b'While walking the streets, Ichigo, spotting Isshin meeting with Urahara in an alley, hides.'
b'After an exchange of words between the pair, Jackie activates her Fullbring, Dirty Boots, and they begin to fight.[394] Telling Ichigo he is too lax, and he cannot take his time getting into a battle, Jackie warns Ichigo because he is in a living body, he will die if he keeps taking her attacks with his body.'
b'After being asked who taught him to fight, Ichigo explains he first learned from Urahara, but he learned from his battles as time went on, saying even though he was only a Shinigami for a brief time, he probably has more experience in battle than Xcution.[395]@.'
b"As Reiatsu from Ichigo's badge begins to engulf his right arm, Ichigo begins to tire."
b"When Jackie says they will abort the training, as Ichigo's Fullbring is going berserk in a way she has never seen before, Ichigo is adamant in continuing."
b'As Jackie calls for K\xc5\xabgo to retrieve Riruka to end the training, Ichigo, pinning her to the ground, says his Fullbring is not going berserk and has always been like this.'
b'When Tsukishima arrives at the Xcution headquarters, he cuts through the fish tank, and Ichigo emerges, engulfed in Reiatsu shaped similarly to his Shinigami shihakush\xc5\x8d.[397] Asking who he is, Ichigo clashes with him.'
b"When Sado attacks Tsukishima to protect Ichigo's new powers, Ichigo, learning he was being protected from the truth, realizes Tsukishima attacked both Ury\xc5\xab and Orihime."
b'Managing to surprise Tsukishima in the subsequent clash, Ichigo is swiftly overwhelmed.'
b'Ichigo attacks Tsukishima from behind.@.'
b'As Ichigo tries to resume fighting, he is stopped by Sado, who tells him Tsukishima is too far ahead of him, and he cannot win in his current state.'
b"Using his Fullbring, Yukio Hans Vorarlberna seals Ichigo, preventing him from interacting with Tsukishima.[399][400][401] Later, in Xcution's back-up hideout, Yukio frees Ichigo, who asks what happened with Tsukishima."
b'When K\xc5\xabgo states he has fled for now, Ichigo asks what K\xc5\xabgo is worried about.'
b"Stating if Tsukishima wanted to harm Xcution, he could have kept going, but it seems his objective is Ichigo, K\xc5\xabgo tells Yukio to help with Ichigo's training."
b'When Ichigo asks if it will be a live battle, K\xc5\xabgo, saying that is what seems to work best with him, states he will fight Ichigo himself.[402]@.'
b'Yukio loads Ichigo and K\xc5\xabgo into his console.'
b"Seeing this, Ichigo realizes this is what happened to him before on the rooftops, and K\xc5\xabgo explains Yukio's Fullbring."
b"When K\xc5\xabgo asks if Ichigo needs a tutorial, he, saying he understands, activates his Fullbring, and they charge at each other.[403] Arriving inside Yukio's game world to find a badly injured Ichigo lying on the ground, Orihime begins to heal him."
b"When Ichigo guesses Sado called her, Sado, arriving, confirms this, saying he knows Ichigo did not want to get Orihime wrapped up in this, but they will need her.[404] When K\xc5\xabgo, growing impatient, asks Ichigo if he is ready to fight, Ichigo says yes, ignoring Orihime's protest."
b"As he attacks K\xc5\xabgo up close to counter the range of his sword, K\xc5\xabgo, fending him off, injures Ichigo's leg.[406] As they fight, Ichigo notes he cannot feel anything from K\xc5\xabgo's sword, comparing it with his battle with Gin Ichimaru."
b"Slashing Ichigo's eyes, K\xc5\xabgo notes when Ichigo lost his powers, he also lost his resolve.[407]@."
b'Blind and confused, Ichigo, demanding to know what K\xc5\xabgo is doing, states he does not trust him, as he is not helping him as he had promised he would.'
b'K\xc5\xabgo states their deal was to get his Shinigami powers back, and if he did not trust him, he should not have agreed to his training.'
b"When Yukio prevents Orihime from interfering, an enraged Ichigo, attacking, tries to dodge K\xc5\xabgo's attacks by sensing the presence and sound of his opponent, but K\xc5\xabgo, further injuring him, leaves Ichigo lying on the ground, impaled with his sword."
b'Walking away, K\xc5\xabgo, telling Ichigo he is going to kill Sado and Orihime, further taunts him.'
b"Putting his life on the line to control the explosion, K\xc5\xabgo expresses his pride in Ichigo's accomplishment, stating his villain act is not the best, and welcomes Ichigo to Xcution.[408]@."
b'When K\xc5\xabgo asks if Ichigo saw something when he completed his Fullbring, Ichigo is shocked he knows this.'
b"K\xc5\xabgo says Ichigo saw him bathed in Reiatsu, which is why he cut Ichigo's eyes, as that is proof Ichigo is beginning to regain his Shinigami powers."
b'K\xc5\xabgo explains when Ichigo lost his Reiatsu, a tiny portion accumulated in a single location inside of him over time, which is why they used the Reiatsu flowing from his badge to jolt that awake.'
b'He says all that is left to do is to beef up his new body and powers, and his Fullbring and Shinigami powers will fuse, giving Ichigo a power transcending that of a Shinigami.'
b'As Tatsuki begins to lecture Ichigo on staying out so late, Tsukishima, telling Ichigo he called everyone, starts to call Sado and Orihime as well.'
b'As he is on the phone, Ichigo attacks him, prompting Tatsuki to berate Ichigo for attacking his relative.'
b'As Ichigo decides against telling her about Shinigami and Hollows, as it would make her uncomfortable, Tsukishima arrives at the store, and Ichigo, fleeing once again, says he needs someone in their right mind.'
b'K\xc5\xabgo takes Ichigo to a location, which he says no members of Xcution know about, to discuss what has transpired.'
b"When Ichigo wonders why everyone is acting the way they are, K\xc5\xabgo tells Ichigo that, thanks to information Sado provided about Tsukishima's attack on Orihime and with what has transpired, his ability may be inserting himself into people's pasts."
b'When Ichigo asks if it would stop if Tsukishima were to die, K\xc5\xabgo, telling Ichigo he does not know, asks if Ichigo could kill him despite this.'
b"As Ichigo, angrily rushing towards Tsukishima when he spots him, reaches for his badge, K\xc5\xabgo, stopping him, warns Ichigo if he is correct about Tsukishima's ability, they will be in trouble if he is cut even once."
b'As a reluctant Ichigo enters the mansion, his family and friends, greeting him, tell a shocked Ichigo he should be happy Tsukishima is not angry, urging him to apologize.'
b'K\xc5\xabgo tells him not to worry, because even though they view Tsukishima as a friend, they still view Ichigo as their friend.'
b"As Tsukishima appears behind Ichigo, K\xc5\xabgo appears, having destroyed the stairs so Ichigo's family and friends cannot follow, and tells Ichigo he can now fight without holding back."
b'Ichigo activates his Fullbring, and while Tsukishima is activating his, Ichigo cuts off his left arm.'
b'As Tsukishima expresses his surprise at Ichigo mastering his Fullbring in such a short time, Ichigo tells him he arrived to kill him.'
b'As Sado bursts through the window, he and Orihime shield Tsukishima.[412]@.'
b"As Orihime heals Tsukishima's arm, Ichigo is left unable to believe Sado and Orihime have become the same as the others."
b'As Both Orihime and Sado say Ichigo was able to save Rukia and defeat Aizen because Tsukishima helped him do so, Tsukishima, appearing behind Ichigo, asks him if he understands, but Ichigo tries to attack him.[413] As Tsukishima reveals the ability of his Fullbring, Book of the End, is to modify the past of those affected by it, Ichigo tries to attack him, but Orihime stops him with her Santen Kesshun.'
b'As Sado, trying to attack Ichigo, says he did not become strong to fight with Ichigo, he attacks again, and Ichigo is pushed outside from the force of the attack.'
b'When Tsukishima appears above Ichigo, he charges at him.[414]@.'
b"K\xc5\xabgo protects Ichigo from Tsukishima's attack.@."
b'As they fight, Tsukishima gets behind Ichigo to attack him, but K\xc5\xabgo takes the attack instead.[415] When Ichigo rushes to see if K\xc5\xabgo is alright, K\xc5\xabgo insists he is a comrade.'
b'When Ury\xc5\xab arrives, Ichigo questions his allegiance.'
b"As Ury\xc5\xab tells Ichigo it was K\xc5\xabgo who attacked him, K\xc5\xabgo attacks Ichigo, who asks if K\xc5\xabgo was turned by Tsukishima's powers."
b'Revealing their allegiance was a ruse, and Tsukishima had just returned him back to normal by cutting him a second time, K\xc5\xabgo, merging the Substitute Shinigami Badge he had with his sword, tells Ichigo it is time to relieve him of his Fullbring, stabbing Ichigo through his chest.[416]@.'
b'K\xc5\xabgo reveals he was the one who actually attacked Ury\xc5\xab, and ordered Tsukishima to cut him, making them "enemies" who betrayed each other.'
b"K\xc5\xabgo further states Tsukishima's ability prevented Ichigo from suspecting him."
b"As K\xc5\xabgo withdraws his blade from Ichigo's chest and Ichigo's Fullbring disappears, Ichigo thinks about how hard it was for him to go seventeen months without any power, and when he thought he found a way, he was so happy he could protect his friends again."
b'When a distraught Ichigo asks K\xc5\xabgo to give his power back, K\xc5\xabgo states it was power he gave to Ichigo, and it belongs to him.'
b'Ichigo realizes that it was Rukia who stabbed him.@.'
b"After Tsukishima and K\xc5\xabgo leave, Ichigo is stabbed in the back by Rukia with a special sword containing the Reiatsu of the Gotei 13's senior officers and other Shinigami."
b'Ichigo emerges from the resulting explosion with a new Shinigami outfit and a slightly altered Zangetsu, ready to fight.'
b"Greeting Ichigo, Rukia, momentarily berating him, reveals Urahara told her about Tsukishima's ability."
b'Reassuring him about this, she explains about the sword Urahara made to restore Shinigami powers to Ichigo.'
b"Rukia tells K\xc5\xabgo he only stole a small portion of Ichigo's power, which had Ichigo's Fullbring, and Ichigo's Shinigami powers well up from deep inside; he could never take that from him."
b'Ichigo fires a Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d at K\xc5\xabgo.[418][419]@.'
b'Ichigo fires Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d at K\xc5\xabgo.@.'
b"As Ichigo's Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d misses K\xc5\xabgo and K\xc5\xabgo tries to retreat, Ichigo, stopping him, attacks K\xc5\xabgo with another Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d before asking if it was a crime to transfer Shinigami powers to a Human."
b"As Renji reveals Captain-Commander Yamamoto ordered all captains and lieutenants to put their Reiatsu into Urahara's sword to help bring back Ichigo's Shinigami powers, Hitsugaya tells him he did this because Ichigo was able to change Soul Society through his actions, and he should accept it proudly."
b'As Ichigo notices K\xc5\xabgo emerging from the dust below, Hitsugaya tells Ichigo Yamamoto also gave the order to stop the original Substitute Shinigami, K\xc5\xabgo Ginj\xc5\x8d.[420] When Ichigo is confused about this, Hitsugaya, reminding him of when Ukitake gave him his badge, tells Ichigo the Substitute Shinigami law was created solely because of K\xc5\xabgo before stating they need to focus on K\xc5\xabgo right now.'
b'Thanking Ichigo, K\xc5\xabgo says if he had not taken his powers, he would have been dead by now.[421]@.'
b"After K\xc5\xabgo grants the other members of Xcution part of Ichigo's Fullbring, Ichigo attacks them all."
b"Reminding Ichigo they received his Fullbring powers, which allows for them to wear their powers as a mantle, he says with Ichigo's help, his Invaders Must Die is now able to influence the world outside his console.[422] After Yukio uses his Fullbring to split everyone up into individual rooms, Ichigo and Ury\xc5\xab finds themselves facing K\xc5\xabgo in a replica of Karakura Town, an environment which K\xc5\xabgo says he picked so Ichigo could fight easier."
b'When Ichigo asks if Ury\xc5\xab is hurt, the Quincy, saying Rukia healed him, apologizes to Ichigo, saying when he first saw the Substitute Badge, he had thought there were other Substitutes before him.'
b'He thought if the previous one was alive, they would have told Ichigo, and if he was dead, they would have said why, leading Ury\xc5\xab to believe Soul Society did not know.'
b"Ichigo falling victim to K\xc5\xabgo's Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d.@."
b'While Ichigo and Ury\xc5\xab fight K\xc5\xabgo, they begin hiding from him.'
b"When Ichigo asks Ury\xc5\xab if he has a plan, Ury\xc5\xab tells him he was not trying to come up with one, but rather he was observing K\xc5\xabgo's Reiatsu."
b'Abruptly leaving to confront K\xc5\xabgo, Ichigo attacks him with a Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d, but K\xc5\xabgo, cutting through it with his sword, attacks him with a Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d as well, surprising Ichigo.'
b"Ury\xc5\xab explains K\xc5\xabgo, in addition to taking his Fullbring and Reiatsu, must have taken Ichigo's full abilities as well.[424] As K\xc5\xabgo and Ichigo continue to fight, K\xc5\xabgo asks him what he is fighting for, which confuses Ichigo."
b'K\xc5\xabgo confirms Tsukishima is dying, and if a Fullbringer dies, all traces of their ability disappear.'
b'He asks Ichigo what he is fighting for, but when Ichigo does not answer him, K\xc5\xabgo informs him of an enemy he should be fighting.[425]@.'
b"K\xc5\xabgo, stating the Substitute Shinigami Badge is given out whether the Substitute in question is beneficial to Soul Society or not, explains it has no authority, and its true purpose is to observe and restrict Ichigo's Shinigami powers while he has it with him."
b"When K\xc5\xabgo says this scheme was designed by Ukitake to control Substitute Shinigami, an enraged Ichigo releases his Bankai, which shatters the pocket dimension.[426] Dismissing K\xc5\xabgo's words, Ichigo says he knew Ukitake was not trying to mislead him."
b"As Tsukishima tries to attack Ichigo, Riruka blocks the attack with her body instead.[429] Sometime after the fighting ends, he is at Urahara's shop, waiting for Riruka to wake up so he can make sure she is okay."
b'Ichigo greeted by the captains upon his return to Soul Society.@.'
b"Ichigo goes to Soul Society to acquire K\xc5\xabgo's body so he may bury it in the Human World."

b"Later, Nel Tu and Pesche arrive in the Human World in order to request Ichigo's aid.[438] After Ury\xc5\xab declines to come with them, Ichigo, Orihime, Sado and Urahara travel to Hueco Mundo in order to investigate.[439] Upon arriving, they witness the slaughter and destruction left in the wake of the Wandenreich.[440] Coming across a Wandenreich camp, Ichigo and the others watch as the Tres Bestias intervene in the Wandenreich's selection of Arrancar soldiers."
b'After the Tres Bestias are defeated,[441][442] Ichigo fights Quilge Opie as Orihime tends to the wounded.'
b'Later, after Quilge activates Quincy: Vollst\xc3\xa4ndig, the Tres Bestias regain consciousness and unleash Ayon against him.[443][444] When Quilge absorbs Ayon with Sklaverei and begins to absorb Orihime and the others, Ichigo activates his Bankai and attacks him.[445]@.'
b'Eventually, Urahara is contacted by Akon and informs Ichigo the Wandenreich is currently attacking Soul Society.[446] As Ichigo travels through a Garganta opened by Urahara, Akon informs him of the situation in Soul Society.'
b"When Quilge traps him in a Reishi prison, Ichigo loses contact with Akon and is unable to free himself.[447][448][449][450] Eventually, Akon frees Ichigo, who enters Soul Society and travels to a heavily wounded Byakuya's location."
b'After Byakuya begs him to save Soul Society, Ichigo confronts Yhwach.[451] Upon learning Yhwach is the one who ordered the destruction of the Seireitei, an enraged Ichigo attacks him, only to be taken down with ease.'

b'The blade of Tensa Zangetsu is broken by Jugram Haschwalth.@.'
b"Emerging from this, Yhwach informs Ichigo that Quilge's cage was not meant to hold a Quincy."
b'Hinting at a secret regarding Masaki, Yhwach attempts to subdue Ichigo once more, only to be stopped by "shadows".'
b"When Ichigo attempts to stop Yhwach from leaving, Jugram Haschwalth cuts the blade of Tensa Zangetsu in two.[453] Afterwards, Ichigo visits a wounded Rukia and Renji in the hospital before being summoned to the 12th Division.[454] After Mayuri reveals a broken Bankai can never be fixed, Ichigo witnesses the arrival of the Royal Guard,[455] who take him to the Soul King Palace in order to reforge his Bankai.[456][457] After being healed by Tenjir\xc5\x8d Kirinji's hot springs[458][459] and having his power restored and increased by Kirio Hikifune's food,[460] Ichigo travels to \xc5\x8cetsu Nimaiya's palace, where he and Renji are forced to fight the Asauchi in order to have their Zanpakut\xc5\x8d reforged.[461] Three days later, Ichigo has failed to defeat the Asauchi and is sent back to the Human World by Nimaiya.[462] After Ikumi takes him in, Ichigo is found by Isshin, who tells him how he met Masaki, that she was a Quincy and reveals the circumstances surrounding her death.[463][464][465]@."

b"Afterwards, Ichigo returns to Nimaiya's palace, where he chooses an Asauchi who resembles Ichigo's inner Hollow.[466] Traveling to Nimaiya's forge,[467] Ichigo watches as Nimaiya's bodyguards help him forge Ichigo's new Zanpakut\xc5\x8d."
b"When he questions Nimaiya about the nature of his forging, Ichigo learns the being who claimed to be Zangetsu is actually his Quincy powers and heavily resembles Yhwach from 1000 years ago.[468] Entering his inner world, Ichigo demands answers from the being he knows as Zangetsu, who reveals Hollow Ichigo is Ichigo's true Zanpakut\xc5\x8d, whom he has been mostly suppressing."
b'Afterwards, he allows Ichigo to access the full power of his true Zanpakut\xc5\x8d.[469] In the real world, Ichigo grabs his new Zanpakut\xc5\x8d while it is being forged, which Nimaiya allows.'
b'After a burst of heat, Ichigo stands with his new Zanpakut\xc5\x8d, which is now comprised of two distinct blades, and acknowledges both his Quincy powers and the real Zangetsu as being his Zanpakut\xc5\x8d.[470]@.'
b"With some more of Hikifune's infused food, heads off to join the battle.[472] Telling Urahara it will take some time for him to get there, Ichigo asks him to resist until he arrives even if the fight gets tough."
b"As Urahara confirms this, Ichigo notes Urahara did not say anything about the Seireitei's current condition and rockets forward.[473]@."
b"While Giselle Gewelle, Liltotto Lamperd, Candice Catnipp and Meninas McAllon are trying to finish off the defeated Kenpachi Zaraki, Ichigo arrives in Seireitei and goes to Kenpachi's side, commenting on Zaraki's condition and that he came there to help him.[474] Candice attacks him, but Ichigo grabs her arm and throws her into a building before repeating the process with Liltotto, Meninas, and Giselle."
b'In response, Ichigo unleashes a Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d, which cancels out the attack.'
b'However, Ichigo merely crosses the path of his sword swings and fires Getsuga J\xc5\xabjish\xc5\x8d at the oncoming blast.[476] When Candice attempts to counter his attack, Ichigo yells at her to get out of the way.[477] Surprised when Bazz-B attacks the four Sternritter, Ichigo prepares to fight both the quartet, Bazz-B and three other newly arrive Sternritter at once before being startled by a column of light piercing the heavens behind him.[478]@.'
b'As Ichigo turns to face it, Yhwach begins speaking to him and notes that Ichigo broke through all the 72 barriers between Soul Society and the Soul King Palace on his way back down to Seireitei.'
b'However, Renji intervenes and tells Ichigo to go to Yhwach, prompting Ichigo to leave as the Sternritter are intercepted by several other Shinigami.[479] As Ichigo rushes toward Yhwach, Ury\xc5\xab fires a Heilig Pfeil at him and tells him to go home.'
b'Ichigo expresses shock and wonders why Ury\xc5\xab is there.'
b'However, Santen Kesshun blocks the barrage as Orihime and Sado emerge from a Garganta.'
b"As Ury\xc5\xab, Yhwach and Haschwalth vanish, Ichigo continues to call out to his friend.[480] Afterwards, upon seeing Ichigo's distraught expression, Sado throws him into a building and demands to know what he is doing."
b'He points out how Ury\xc5\xab must have thought deeply about his decision, which calms Ichigo down and they discuss how they can take Ury\xc5\xab back.'
b'They are interrupted by Urahara, who offers to take Ichigo to the Soul King Palace.[481]@.'
b'Ichigo talks to Orihime about the time they entered Soul Society to rescue Rukia.@.'

b"After a moment of collecting their thoughts, Ichigo, Orihime, Sado, Ganju and Yoruichi are launched towards the Soul King Palace.[482] When Orihime reminisces about the time they entered Soul Society to rescue Rukia with Ury\xc5\xab alongside them, Ichigo assures her that they will defeat Yhwach and take Ury\xc5\xab back.[483] Upon arriving at the palace, Ichigo spots Ichib\xc4\x93's head lying on the ground in front of him."
b'After explaining how this happened, Ichib\xc4\x93 asks Ichigo to stop Yhwach from killing the Soul King as Ichigo and his friends rush toward the main palace.[484]@.'
b'Ichigo attacks the Soul King against his will.@.'
b'Ichigo and the others arrive at the main palace, where they confront Yhwach.[485] When Ichigo tells Yhwach that they have come to stop him, Yhwach reveals that he saw it already, prompting Ichigo to ask him what he means and why his eyes have changed.'
b"After Yhwach explains his ability to see the future and reveals he has already attacked the Soul King, Ichigo attempts to help the king, but is surprised when his right side is enveloped in Blut Vene veins upon touching Yhwach's sword."
b"Yhwach explains how the Quincy blood within Ichigo's body will never tolerate the Soul King's existence and invites him to watch the destruction of Soul Society as Ichigo slashes the Soul King diagonally across the chest.[486]@."
b"Ichigo wonders why he cannot let go of the sword and why he was forced to attack the king, prompting Yhwach to explain how he transferred the Reiatsu still present in his sword to him, which Ichigo's blood reacted to."
b'Upon hearing this, Ichigo manages to dispel the veins covering his arm and grabs Zangetsu before attacking Yhwach, who effortlessly blocks him while proclaiming that there is no point in fighting him anymore because Soul Society will collapse regardless of what happens to him.[487]@.'
b'Ichigo prevents Yhwach from destroying the Soul King.@.'
b'When Mimihagi appears and stabilizes the Soul King, Ichigo looks at it in shock.[488] Yhwach attempts to destroy both of them, but Ichigo stops him, allowing Yoruichi to move in and begin the process of replacing the Soul King.'
b'Ichigo states he is here to protect Soul Society, Hueco Mundo, and the Human World, prompting Yhwach to demand to know if Ichigo thinks only he can do this.'
b"Proclaiming that he cannot simply sit by even if he is replaceable, Ichigo blasts Yhwach with a Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d and tells Yhwach it does not matter if Yhwach's blood runs in his veins because he will not do Yhwach's bidding.[489]@."
b'Yhwach blasts Ichigo away.@.'
b'Yhwach claims that he has never tried to make Ichigo do his bidding, prompting Ichigo to ask him what he means.'
b"Yhwach claims that all of Ichigo's fighting and growth up until now have been preparing him for killing the Soul King and that this has all benefited him because they share the same blood."
b'Ichigo angrily attacks Yhwach and proclaims he still intends to stop him, only for Yhwach to ask him if his resentment toward him is truly justified.'
b'When Ury\xc5\xab arrives and shoots Yoruichi in the shoulder, causing her barrier to shatter, a shocked Ichigo demands to know what he just did before being blasted away by Yhwach.'
b'After throwing Yoruichi out of the palace, Yhwach places his hand on the Soul King, but Ichigo attempts to attack him, only to be distracted by another attack from Ury\xc5\xab.'
b'As Yhwach rips Mimihagi off of the Soul King, Ury\xc5\xab tells Ichigo not to interfere, prompting Ichigo to demand to know what he is doing.[490]@.'
b'When Ury\xc5\xab tells them to not move if they do not want to be shot, Ichigo attempts to move, prompting Ury\xc5\xab to shoot his sword.'
b'Ichigo asks Ury\xc5\xab if he does not know what will happen if Yhwach succeeds in killing the Soul King, but Ury\xc5\xab reveals he already knows, causing Ichigo to again question his motives.'
b'After claiming that being a Quincy is his reason, Ury\xc5\xab destroys the ground beneath Ichigo, causing Ichigo to fall off the palace as Lille Barro fires another Heilig Pfeil after him.[491] Ichigo manages to catch and destroy the Heilig Pfeil as Orihime catches him, herself, Sado, and Ganju with Santen Kesshun, which is grappled by Yoruichi, who reels them up to one of the floating cities.'
b"However, Kon suddenly bursts out of Ichigo's pocket in his muscular form, causing Ichigo to fall back and hit his head on Orihime, knocking him out.[492]@."
b'Ichigo wonders how they are going to get back up to the palace, before having a Garganta open behind her to reveal Grimmjow, whose arrival shocks Ichigo.[493] Grimmjow greets Ichigo and before noting the scars he gave Ichigo have already healed.'
b'Nelliel explains to a shocked Ichigo that Urahara made her an armband that allows her to maintain her adult form.'
b'Ichigo arrives at the altered Soul King Palace.@.'
b'After Yoruichi explains how they are getting to the palace by using a device she put near the Soul King as a destination point, Ichigo confirms that he understands.'
b'Soon after, he asks Grimmjow why he is helping them, and is amused when Grimmjow claims he is only doing so because there will be no chance to fight him if Yhwach destroys everything.[495] As Ichigo and the others prepare themselves, they are interrupted by Yukio informing them that he will not be leaving the box to fight.'
b"While Ichigo expresses confusion at Yoruichi's comparison of him to her brother, Grimmjow decides to move ahead without the group, prompting Ichigo to attempt to stop him."
b'Ichigo then begins to wonder nervously if the Reiatsu he is sensing really belongs to Shunsui Ky\xc5\x8draku.[499] Ichigo loses his battle with Askin and is found lying face down on the ground by Orihime and Sado.'
b'Ichigo warns them to stay back as Sado attacks Askin.[500] Yoruichi intercepts Askin, and Ichigo eventually manages to stand up.'
b'Ichigo, Sado, and Orihime then run away from the battlefield.[501]@.'
b'Ichigo watches in shock as Haschwalth orders Ury\xc5\xab to prove his loyalty by attacking him, and clashes with his friend.'
b"Ichigo asks Ury\xc5\xab what he is trying to do and why he joined the Quincy so he would at least know Ury\xc5\xab's motivation and bring him back to their side."
b'After forcing them away from Haschwalth, Ury\xc5\xab tosses Ichigo his Sun Key, which could teleport them to the Human World, and tells him to take his friends and leave as he would stay behind and take down Wahrwelt himself using a plan he had already begun.'
b'Ichigo argues against this plan, saying that they just needed to take down Yhwach, but Ury\xc5\xab says it is impossible and it is up to him to destroy Wahrwelt as his own Reiatsu is essential to the plan.'
b"Ury\xc5\xab tells Ichigo to go, but they are confronted by Haschwalth, who knew Ury\xc5\xab's plan.[503]@."
b'Ury\xc5\xab realizes that as long as Haschwalth possesses The Almighty, Yhwach is vulnerable and tells Ichigo to go to the highest point of Silbern to confront Yhwach while he deals with Haschwalth.'
b'Ichigo initially protests but duly heads off with Orihime and Sado.'
b'Ichigo pulls Orihime away from an attack, and Sado blocks another attack aimed at them.'
b'The clash causes part of the walkway to fall away, separating Ichigo and Orihime from Sado.'
b'They reach the entrance to the throne room and Ichigo tells Orihime that he is counting on her to act as his defense.[505] Ichigo approaches Yhwach, who can see his monstrous Reiatsu emanating from his body, and Yhwach wonders what Ichigo will do.'
b'Ichigo gets annoyed, knowing that Yhwach can see his next move, only for Yhwach to reveal that he does not have The Almighty activated as he wants to savor his reunion with his "son".'
b'Ichigo says that Yhwach is not his real father lambasts the Quincy for killing his mother.[506]@.'
b"As Ichigo attempts to attack Yhwach, Orihime shields her friend from the Quincy's attacks."
b"Yhwach states that Masaki's death was necessary in order for him to gain power.[507] Ichigo races at Yhwach again despite Orihime's protests, and Yhwach blocks him with dark energy, chiding him for his recklessness and saying that his death is inevitable."
b"As Ichigo makes yet another charge, Yhwach surrounds him in dark energy and states that Ichigo's powers are not rightfully his and it is time they return to their progenitor.[508] With Ichigo continuing to rush into his torrent of dark energy, Yhwach wonders why Ichigo is not revealing his true power and notes that he will destroy both Soul Society and the Human World if not stopped."
b"However, upon seeing the tip of his blade turning white, Ichigo has Orihime shield him and reveals to her that he needed to awaken something with Yhwach's Quincy Reiatsu, hence his repeated and seemingly reckless headlong charges."
b'An explosion of energy engulfs Ichigo, and he enters a new form with Hollow characteristics.[509]@.'
b'Ichigo clashes with Yhwach after forcing him to fight at close range.@.'
b"Ichigo confirms Yhwach's assessment that this is the form he takes on when melding with his Hollow powers before explaining how he reforged his Zanpakut\xc5\x8d after his Hollow and Quincy powers came into balance with one another."
b"Noting that they should logically come forth if that balance is disrupted, Ichigo states that his Hollow powers have always come forth when he exerted his Shinigami powers before revealing that he had to draw them out with the help of Yhwach's power."
b'As Yhwach grins at this, Ichigo moves in front of Santen Kesshun while telling Orihime to keep up her guard before engaging in close range combat with Yhwach.'
b'Ichigo is pushed back by the Quincy and then forms a Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d and fuses it with a Gran Rey Cero before firing it at Yhwach.[510]@.'
b'Noting that a combined attack like this is fitting for a racial hybrid like Ichigo, Yhwach repels the attack and clashes with the young Shinigami.'
b'When Ichigo is impaled by a number of traps, Yhwach states that Ichigo should know that The Almighty allows him to see the future, but Ichigo reasons that there must be some limit to his precognitive ability.'
b'Yhwach reveals that Ichigo made a miscalculation by believing that the future is linear and explains that it diverges in countless directions from a given point in time like grains of sand in the wind.'
b'As Yhwach tells him to keep fighting and not give in to despair, Ichigo decries the idea of falling into despair after he has broken through it so many times in order to reach this moment before activating his Bankai.[511]@.'
b"However, Yhwach immediately breaks off part of Tensa Zangetsu's blade and his horn, seemingly without moving."
b"Yhwach continues to injure Ichigo despite Orihime shielding him, before eventually revealing that The Almighty lets him transform the future as well as foresee it.[512] Ichigo listens as Yhwach states that The Almighty is no different from his and Orihime's powers because he can also influence only what he can see, which is the entirety of fate."
b'Yhwach claims that Ichigo has only been able to overcome his despair and change his fate up until now because he was not present and declares that he will cut down any future Ichigo tries to create for himself.'
b'He tells Ichigo that he can begin despairing now, prompting Ichigo to begin screaming in anger.[513]@.'
b"Yhwach absorbs Ichigo's power.@."
b"Noting that neither his sword nor Orihime's powers have any effect, Ichigo loses all hope of winning, prompting Yhwach to drop him while claiming that all Ichigo accomplished was providing him with some entertainment before preparing to take back the power Ichigo had inherited from him.[514] Black veins encompass Ichigo and the surrounding area as he realizes his Quincy and Hollow powers are fading away."
b'As his merged Hollow form dissipates, Ichigo falls to the ground.[515]@.'
b"As Yhwach leaves through a portal, Rukia and Renji show up, with Renji trying and failing to attack Yhwach from behind despite Ichigo's silent protests."
b"Soon afterward, despite Orihime's inability to restore Tensa Zangetsu, Renji hoists Ichigo up and declares that they will be confronting Yhwach, prompting Rukia to point out that simply charging in will accomplish nothing."
b"However, they are all interrupted when Ichigo is stabbed through the shoulder by Sh\xc5\xabkur\xc5\x8d Tsukishima, who reveals that he has altered the past so that Tensa Zangetsu can be fixed at K\xc5\xabgo's behest."
b'When Tsukishima asks him if they are even now, Ichigo confidently stands up with his restored Bankai and confirms this.[516]@.'
b'Ichigo unleashing a powerful Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d against Yhwach.@.'
b'Shortly after his Bankai is fixed, Ichigo and Renji begin running through the portal with Reishi footholds.'
b'Ichigo then questions if Renji tagging along was a good idea.'
b'However, Yhwach uses The Almighty to avoid the attack and breaks Tensa Zangetsu once more.[517] After being pushed back by an energy attack from Yhwach, Ichigo glares at him as Yhwach questions why he did not have Orihime heal him before he came here.'
b'Ichigo proceeds to watch as Aizen takes on Yhwach while disguising himself as both Renji and Ichigo.'
b'When Aizen successfully tricks Yhwach into believing he has killed him, Ichigo impales Yhwach from behind before unleashing a powerful Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d.[518]@.'
b'Ichigo cuts Yhwach in half.@.'
b'As Ichigo cuts him in half, Yhwach dissolves into a mass of darkness, prompting Aizen to commend Ichigo for responding to his usage of Ky\xc5\x8dka Suigetsu as quickly as he did.'
b'When Ichigo notes that he experienced a strange feeling similar to when Aizen used Ky\xc5\x8dka Suigetsu on his allies, prompting Aizen to explain how he released it before Ichigo arrived and confirmed that it would work on Yhwach before revealing that Ichigo was the final component in his plan because he was unaffected by it.'
b"Suddenly, Yhwach's darkness engulfs Aizen as Yhwach himself notes that the power of Ky\xc5\x8dka Suigetsu appears to have run out before reforming as he asks Ichigo if he really thought an attack of that caliber would be enough to kill him."
b"Proclaiming that he can even rewrite futures where he dies using The Almighty, Yhwach bashes Tensa Zangetsu out of Ichigo's hand and engulfs him and the rest of the Seireitei in his darkness before declaring that everything will lose its form and become one before his power."
b'However, Yhwach is interrupted when Ury\xc5\xab fires the silver arrowhead through his chest, to the surprise of both him and Ichigo.'
b"Yhwach's darkness suddenly clears from his body as he briefly loses his powers, prompting Ury\xc5\xab to tell Ichigo to move now."
b"However, the blade instead crumbles to reveal the original Zangetsu in Ichigo's hands, prompting a stunned Yhwach to realize that this is what Haschwalth was trying to warn him about with his dream as Ichigo cuts him in two.[519] Yhwach grabs hold of Zangetsu and laments to Ichigo how the path is being closed to a world without fear and how thanks to Ichigo existence will continue as it always has in a cycle of life and death.[520]@."
b'Less than ten years later, Ichigo marries Orihime and they have a son named Kazui Kurosaki.'
b'Rukia and Renji come to the Kurosaki Clinic and Ichigo greets them at the door, inviting them inside.'
b"As Sado's match begins, Ichigo calls Orihime to the living room and asks her where Kazui is."
b'Ichigo then asks Rukia and Renji about their child coming, and after realizing she has disappeared, Rukia flippantly guesses that she is getting into fights.'
b"Ichigo's Substitute Shinigami Badge.@."
b"Substitute Shinigami Badge (\xe4\xbb\xa3\xe8\xa1\x8c\xe8\xa8\xbc \xe6\xad\xbb\xe7\xa5\x9e\xe4\xbb\xa3\xe8\xa1\x8c, Daik\xc5\x8dsh\xc5\x8d Shinigami Daik\xc5\x8d): Given to Ichigo by Ukitake before leaving Soul Society for the first time, the pendant he commonly carries on his belt signifies his position as a Substitute Shinigami, allowing him to remain active in the Human World.[177][178] The pendant gives Ichigo the ability to separate his soul from his body in the absence of Rukia's glove or Kon."
b'Ukitake informs Ichigo the badge can also be dangerous, and thus it has built-in protection making it invisible to normal Humans.[522][523] Zennosuke Kurumadani tells Ichigo he has never heard of his "Seal of Approval", causing Ichigo to refer to it as useless before Shinji\'s arrival.[524] When Ichigo loses his powers, all of the mentioned abilities of the badge are lost as well.[525] K\xc5\xabgo Ginj\xc5\x8d tells Ichigo the true purpose of the badge is to observe and restrict the owner.'
b"It is at once a surveillance device for Soul Society and a device to absorb, analyze, and control the user's Reiatsu."
b"It is also a device for communicating with Soul Society, as Ichigo could hear Rukia's voice coming from it."
b"As the badge absorbed and stored Ichigo's Reiatsu, Ichigo used it as his Fullbring focus.[526]@."
b"These clothes are made from the bones and hair of the members of the Royal Guard, and they possess incredible defensive power, allowing Ichigo to withstand the friction that results from breaking through the 72 barriers between Soul Society and the Soul King Palace without suffering any damage; Yhwach notes that no Shinigami could hope to wear greater garb.[530] These clothes take the form of a white cloth, a floral-patterned bandanna, and a black cloth around the top of Ichigo's head; large, black-outlined weights on either shoulder; a long, double-breasted white cloak; a black sash and a floral-patterned strip of fabric around his waist; and white pants.[531] They are destroyed when Candice Catnipp attacks Ichigo with Galvano Blast.[532]@."
b"Enhanced Strength: Even while not in his Shinigami form, Ichigo is deceptively strong, smashing a man's head through a concrete road with a single kick,[535] and later kicking Asguiaro Ebern from his bedroom into the street without injuring his leg from the man's Hierro.[536]@."
b'Ichigo possesses great reflexes, dodging a strike with no wasted effort and immediately counterattacking.[537] He can strike quickly, without warning, and in rapid succession.[538] His speed allows him to follow the movements of faster opponents to better analyze their movements, and block otherwise fatal strikes.[539] Even when struck by surprise by Tenjir\xc5\x8d Kirinji, who is fast enough to outpace Su\xc3\xac-F\xc4\x93ng, Ichigo counterattacked and injured said attacker without anybody else noticing.[540] Ichigo managed to dodge a surprise point-blank shot to the head and attempt to perform a counter against Robert Accutrone, who was fast enough to match and pressure a fast Captain such as Shunsui in terms of speed.[541]@.'
b"Advanced Growth Rate: According to both Aizen and Urahara, Ichigo's most astounding ability is his growth rate; he grasps the basic control of advanced techniques in days where it would take several years for even the most gifted Shinigami."
b'While it takes most Shinigami at least 10 years to achieve Bankai, he did so in two days (albeit with the assistance of a special device invented by Urahara which was originally intended for three days).[542][543] He gains considerable experience in the use of Shunpo while training with Yoruichi, which was done over the same period as his Bankai.[544] Besides his improvements in his Shinigami abilities, Ichigo greatly increased the time he could maintain his Hollow mask, from eleven seconds to considerably longer amounts of time.'
b'During his first fight with Ulquiorra, he is instantly incapacitated by one Cero blast, even with his Hollow mask (which broke within a second), but only a few hours later, he withstands another Cero from Ulquiorra without undergoing Hollowfication, and can analyze Ulquiorra\'s movements much better than before, when he had "felt like [he] was fighting a machine or a statue" and failed to predict and counter his attacks.[545][546] His latent abilities have been recognized by the Wandenreich as potent enough to make him one of the Special War Powers of Soul Society.[547]@.'
b'Immense Spiritual Power: Ichigo has been noted on several occasions to have tremendously vast levels of spiritual energy, well beyond most other Shinigami.[548] His spiritual power is noted to be heavy, which surprised Renji Abarai.[549] Ichigo constantly gives off Reiatsu at the level of a captain.[550] Even when worn-out in battle, he can continue fighting effectively while still using Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d or unleashing and maintaining his Bankai.[551] Even at less than half strength, his spiritual energy is comparable to a captain-level fighter.[552] His energy is strong enough to hold back the S\xc5\x8dkyoku, a halberd with the destructive force equivalent to one million Zanpakut\xc5\x8d combined, using only his Zanpakut\xc5\x8d.[553] His Reiatsu is light-blue in color.[554] After his training at the Soul King Palace, Ichigo was able to overwhelm four Sternritter simultaneously[555] and then calmly fight on par with a Sternritter using Quincy: Vollst\xc3\xa4ndig using just his Shikai and eventually overpower his foe.[556]@.'
b"Ichigo's Reiatsu after attaining his true power.@."
b"Novice Reiatsu Control: Ichigo's spiritual energy is rather difficult for him to control, as he has no formal training in controlling it, and upon Hollowfication, his Reiatsu fluctuates wildly, with it being unreadable at its lowest point and at its highest point greater than that of the fourth Espada Ulquiorra Cifer.[557] Due to this, and him having far more spiritual energy than his body can consciously contain, it leaks out constantly, preventing him from hiding it and effectively making stealth impossible when dealing with other spiritually-aware beings."
b'He has learned how to harden his spiritual energy and enhance the strength of his attacks, or use it as a barrier to reduce the impact of attacks on him, if not negating them completely.[558] He possesses some skill in channeling his spiritual power, as he was able to destroy the Arbor of the S\xc5\x8dkyoku, a seemingly impossible feat which surprised the Gotei 13, by channeling his spiritual power through his sword into the execution stand.[559] According to Kirio Hikifune, Ichigo has gained control over his fluctuating Reiatsu after his training in the Soul King Palace,[560] and it is now so powerful that it automatically becomes visible when Ichigo is preparing to battle.[561]@.'
b'Master Swordsman: In terms of fighting style while in his Shinigami form, Ichigo relies mainly on swordplay.'
b'While usually fighting right-handed, Ichigo appears to be ambidextrous, as he is proficient in wielding Zangetsu in his left hand.[564][565][566] Since attaining the true form of Zangetsu, he has shown great skill at wielding both blades at once without any trouble.[567]@.'
b'Shunpo Expert: Though not particularly versed in its various techniques, Ichigo is proficient enough in the technique itself to keep up with and even surprise high-level Shinigami with his speed.'
b"Byakuya Kuchiki, one of the most proficient users of Shunpo in Soul Society, complimented Ichigo's growing mastery of the technique.[568] During his first demonstration of this skill, he knocked out three lieutenants and grabbed his Zanpakut\xc5\x8d before any of them hit the ground.[534] After returning from the Soul King Palace, Ichigo has refined his skill in Shunpo, moving several miles in a single leap while simultaneously bypassing the perception of multiple Sternritter.[569]@."
b"Enhanced Strength: When he is in his Shinigami body, Ichigo's already impressive strength is greatly enhanced."
b"He has knocked out three Shinigami lieutenants with a single punch each, one of which shattered one of their Zanpakut\xc5\x8d at the same time.[534] His strength is great enough to easily stop repeated axe blows from Jidanb\xc5\x8d before shattering Jidanb\xc5\x8d's axes in a single swing, and hurl Rukia a dozen meters into Renji's arms and send them both skidding several meters more, achieving both feats with a single hand.[570][571] With a single kick, he can break down and launch a large chunk of a stone wall.[572] After regaining his Shinigami powers, one swing from his Zanpakut\xc5\x8d produced a shockwave powerful enough to overwhelm K\xc5\xabgo Ginj\xc5\x8d, making the Fullbringer mistake it for a Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d.[573] When fighting Quilge Opie, Ichigo grabbed one of his Heilig Pfeil with his bare hand without sustaining any damage, despite the considerable explosion it caused when Ichigo threw it back.[574] After returning from the Soul King Palace, Ichigo has increased in strength, allowing him to throw four Sternritter into separate buildings in rapid succession without any visible effort.[575]@."
b"Immense Endurance: When in his Shinigami form, Ichigo's endurance is strengthened to the point where he can continue fighting effectively after receiving many injuries, and can survive attacks which would easily kill normal Humans."
b'As such, Ichigo can withstand attacks which would be fatal to most Shinigami.[576] Ury\xc5\xab once stated Ichigo was a monster in this regard,[577] and Aizen commented on his ability to continue moving despite grave injuries.[578]@.'
b'Enhanced Durability: Ichigo becomes much more durable in his Shinigami form.'
b"During his last fight with K\xc5\xabgo Ginj\xc5\x8d, he withstood a direct hit from the Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d created by his opponent, and the damage was only done to one of his arms and part of his face.[579] When fighting Quilge Opie, Ichigo withstood the impact of several Heilig Pfeil fired at him, unharmed, despite the powerful explosion each one caused.[580] Tenjir\xc5\x8d Kirinji, a member of the Royal Guard, was amazed at Ichigo's ability to endure the unique healing properties of his White Skeleton Pond and Blood Hell Pond for so long after fully healing without rotting.[581] After his training in the Soul King Palace, his durability has increased to the point where he can withstand a direct attack from Meninas McAllon with only scratches on his face and retain the ability to move afterward, something which Robert Accutrone commended him for.[582]@."
b'Both blades represent a different facet of Ichigo\'s powers: the larger blade represents his inner Hollow (the manifestation of his Shinigami/Hollow powers) and the smaller blade represents "the old man" (the manifestation of his Quincy powers).[584] After gaining his new Zanpakut\xc5\x8d, Ichigo wraps the hilts of both swords in cloth, and now carries the larger blade on his back and the shorter blade on his right hip.[585] After Yhwach absorbs his Hollow and Quincy powers, Zangetsu reverts to its original appearance from when Ichigo first attained Shikai.[586]@.'
b'Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d (\xe6\x9c\x88\xe7\x89\x99\xe5\xa4\xa9\xe8\xa1\x9d, Moon Fang Heaven-Piercer; "Piercer of Heaven" in the English anime): At the instant of the slash, Zangetsu, absorbing Ichigo\'s spiritual energy, releases highly condensed spiritual energy at the tip of the blade, which, magnifying the slash attack, flies forward.[587] This slash takes the form of a crescent moon or the shape of a wave.[588] Ichigo uses this ability without knowing its name several times, but masters the technique later on during his Bankai training.'
b"Ichigo has used this technique in several different manners, such as striking the ground, creating an omnidirectional blast which knocks away incoming attacks, or slashing at the ground, upturning it and crushing everything in its path.[590] After Ichigo regains his Shinigami powers for the second time, his Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d is noticeably larger and stronger than it was before he lost his powers.[591] A single strike from it cleanly cut off the top portion of Tsukishima's mansion and dispersed an entire rainstorm.[592] After gaining his true Zanpakut\xc5\x8d, Ichigo can fire a Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d by simply pointing his smaller sword at the enemy and making a small slash with it.[593] He can also fire a Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d with his larger sword; this version is completely black, and is powerful enough to blast a large hole in the Soul King Palace and knock someone as powerful as Yhwach several meters back.[594]@."
b'Getsuga J\xc5\xabjish\xc5\x8d (\xe6\x9c\x88\xe7\x89\x99\xe5\x8d\x81\xe5\xad\x97\xe8\xa1\x9d, Moon Fang Cross-Shaped Piercer): By firing a Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d with each blade of his true Shikai, Ichigo can fuse them into a large, cross-shaped blast of energy.'
b"The new form of Ichigo's Bankai, Tensa Zangetsu.@."
b'Bankai: Tensa Zangetsu (\xe5\xa4\xa9\xe9\x8e\x96\xe6\x96\xac\xe6\x9c\x88, Heaven Chain Slaying Moon): To activate his Bankai, Ichigo places the two blades of his Shikai side by side, causing a surge of energy to engulf him and the swords.'
b"Tensa Zangetsu takes the form of a khyber knife variation; the smaller black blade comprises the inner part of the sword and has the handle fixed to it, while the base of the sword is slanted and the blade continues with a section jutting out from the underside as a guard, with a chain attached to it that loops over the top and attaches right before the point of the blade.[597] After Ichigo had his Hollow and Quincy powers absorbed by Yhwach, the outer white portion broke during his final battle with the Quincy Emperor to reveal the original form of Ichigo's Shikai, Zangetsu, underneath, due to his Shinigami powers being the only source of power remaining within him at the time.[598]@."
b"Bankai Special Ability: While the power of the true Tensa Zangetsu is currently unknown, a Soul King-empowered Yhwach considered it dangerous enough to necessitate immediately breaking Ichigo's Bankai following its activation during their battle.[599]@."
b'Enhanced Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d: Ichigo can fire a massively powerful Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d.'
b'When this technique was used against a Soul King-empowered Yhwach, Ichigo bifurcated him with the force of the blast[600] and would have killed him were it not for The Almighty allowing Yhwach to reverse his own death.[601]@.'
b'Zangetsu (\xe6\x96\xac\xe6\x9c\x88, Slaying Moon): When Ichigo first becomes a Shinigami, his Zanpakut\xc5\x8d was a standard-looking katana, but oversized, with an equally-oversized brown sheath hung by a strap across his back and over his right shoulder.'
b'It could upturn the ground with a single strike.[602] Because of the weak nature of its spiritual energy, Byakuya Kuchiki easily cut off most of the blade during his first encounter with Ichigo, and Kisuke Urahara subsequently sliced it down to the hilt during their training, forcing Ichigo to learn the name of his Zanpakut\xc5\x8d in order to release its true form.'
b"Ichigo has, on more than one occasion, used Zangetsu's wide blade as a shield from incoming attacks,[610][611] and for deflecting energy attacks.[612] Unlike most Zanpakut\xc5\x8d, which can be sealed into their original form, Zangetsu is always in its Shikai form."
b"Yoruichi Shih\xc5\x8din has stated his Zanpakut\xc5\x8d is a full-time released form type because of Ichigo's vast but uncontrollable spiritual energy upon generation of it, implying it is simply a type of Zanpakut\xc5\x8d which, without proper control of his spiritual energy, remains in Shikai form once in said state.[613]@."
b'Bankai: Tensa Zangetsu (\xe5\xa4\xa9\xe9\x8e\x96\xe6\x96\xac\xe6\x9c\x88, Heaven Chain Slaying Moon): Ichigo points his Zanpakut\xc5\x8d in a straight direction, using either a single hand or both of his hands, with the cloth of his Shikai surrounding his arm and tightening during the activation.'
b"In addition to his sword, Ichigo's robe is replaced with a long-sleeved, ankle-length black coat (or shihakush\xc5\x8d) with red lining, which is closed at his chest and left to flare out into ragged ends, much like that of Zangetsu himself.[622] This coat is part of Ichigo's Bankai, and the damage it can take is directly proportionate to the remaining strength and level of Ichigo's Reiatsu.[623]@."
b'Tensa Zangetsu Version 2.@.'
b'Tensa Zangetsu Version 3.@.'
b"While retaining its manji-like shape, the tsuba becomes more curved and jagged.[625] Tensa Zangetsu's chain is now longer, attaching to both the base of the sword's hilt and to Ichigo's glove, forming a wide loop.[626]@."
b"He effortlessly blocked a punch from Yammy Llargo, an Espada known primarily for his immense strength, and cut through his Hierro with relative ease.[629] The sudden boost in strength upon releasing allows Ichigo to break free from any attack which binds him or prevents him from moving.[333] After his training in the Dangai, Ichigo's strength drastically increases to the point where a single swing of his sword can level a mountain.[630] He can grab Aizen's Zanpakut\xc5\x8d blade with his bare hand without feeling any of the exerted force, though said force could do considerable damage to the surrounding area.[631] He can effortlessly break through Had\xc5\x8d 90."
b"Kurohitsugi, with full incantation, with just his bare hand.[632] After his Shinigami powers are restored, Ichigo can catch a massive blast produced by K\xc5\xabgo Ginj\xc5\x8d's Bankai one-handed and crush it."
b'Enhanced Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d: Tensa Zangetsu retains the use of Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d and can be used in the same ways, but in an enhanced form.'
b'During Byakuya Kuchiki\'s fight with Ichigo, he refers to this attack as a "Kuroi Getsuga" (\xe9\xbb\x92\xe3\x81\x84\xe6\x9c\x88\xe7\x89\x99, "Black Moon Fang"), referring to the attack\'s darkened color.[634] Ichigo has stated the Black Getsuga was originally Hollow Ichigo\'s technique,[635] which has been proven, as Ichigo had no knowledge of it during his fight with Byakuya Kuchiki, and Hollow Ichigo stated all Ichigo was doing when he used the technique was copying his inner Hollow.[636] Ichigo can keep Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d within Tensa Zangetsu to augment his sword swings,[637] or fire it from the tip of the blade as if it were a bullet.[638]@.'
b"His Reiatsu is so intense and rough, as well as thick and heavy, it can suffocate Humans who are in the general vicinity of his released Bankai.[639] Ichigo's Reiatsu is solid in his Bankai.[640] Initially, when he activated his Bankai, he produced a white aura which shot high into the sky.[641][642] Ever since Ichigo defeated his inner Hollow and affirmed his place as a Visored, he produces a deep black spiritual energy with a crimson outline, which emanates off of Ichigo's body when his spiritual pressure is exerted, replacing his white aura.[643] After his training in the Dangai, Ichigo's ability to sense Reiatsu has increased greatly, as he can now sense his sisters blocks away through various buildings and determine their current status.[644] According to S\xc5\x8dsuke Aizen, by achieving evolution into a dimension separate from Shinigami, both Shinigami and Humans have become unable to feel his Reiatsu unless he voluntarily lowers his level and allows them to interfere, in the same way a two-dimensional being is unable to interfere with a three-dimensional being."
b'In this same way, he surmises Ichigo is standing in a dimension even higher than the one he is in.[645] After Ichigo regains his Shinigami powers for the second time, his Bankai activation reverts back to the way it used to be, shooting a white aura high into the sky.'
b"The released energy can break apart Yukio's chatroom, which is said to be indestructible.[646] While in Bankai, Ichigo's Reiatsu turns black, with a blue outline.[647]@."
b'Enhanced Bankai Duration: Since all of his energy is "compressed", usage of his Bankai does not expel as much spiritual power as other Bankai from the point of activation, allowing him to use Tensa Zangetsu for a much longer duration than any other Bankai users of his level.'
b'Ichigo assuming the form of the Final Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d.@.'
b'Saigo no Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d (\xe6\x9c\x80\xe5\xbe\x8c\xe3\x81\xae\xe6\x9c\x88\xe7\x89\x99\xe5\xa4\xa9\xe8\xa1\x9d, The Final Moon Fang Heaven-Piercer): By using this technique, Ichigo becomes Getsuga (\xe6\x9c\x88\xe7\x89\x99, Moon Fang) itself.'
b"It is referred to as the Final Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d because if Ichigo uses it, he loses all of his Shinigami powers.[649] For the duration of the ability, Ichigo's hair becomes waist-length and turns black."
b"In this form, Ichigo's body constantly emits smoky black Reiatsu, most of which is focused around his right arm.[650] Being in this form allows Ichigo to use Mugetsu.[651] Once it is used, the transformation dissipates."
b"Any remaining Reiatsu stabilizes, and he will awaken sometime later (roughly a month), followed shortly by the loss of his remaining Reiryoku.[652] When Ichigo lost his Reiatsu, a tiny portion of it accumulated in a single location inside of him over time,[653] and he began to regain it slightly after a year and a half.[654] While using this technique, Ichigo's Reiatsu turns completely black.[655]@."
b"Initially, Ichigo's Fullbring powers focused on changing the form of his Substitute Shinigami Badge.[659] By recalling the memories of his pride as a Shinigami, Ichigo causes the badge to release black Reiatsu in the shape of the tsuba of Tensa Zangetsu.[660] Like a tsuba, the weapon is used primarily for defense, particularly to block attacks."
b"Ichigo and Jackie Tristan both conclude if he fires three shots in a row, he leaves himself wide open to attack.[669] With his completed Fullbring, Ichigo can produce the Reiatsu tsuba from his sword's guard-badge and fire a barrage of these blades with a single swing, with each one apparently retaining full power, as none lose any blades."
b"Jackie Tristan notes the presence of Bringer Light indicates Ichigo is beginning to master Fullbring.[671] Ichigo can draw on the souls of concrete and solid air in order to propel himself higher and at faster speeds.[672] With his complete Fullbring unleashed, Ichigo's speed is enhanced even further, as he got behind Tsukishima and slice off his left arm before he could even attack him.[673] Similar to his Bankai, Ichigo's speed is great enough to produce dozens of afterimages to confuse his enemy.[666] By focusing this power into a single leg, Ichigo can launch a much faster kick with much greater impact.[674]@."
b"Hollow Mask: Ichigo's Hollow mask has the appearance of what could best be described as a menacing skull."
b"Because Ichigo's inner Hollow took a new form while facing Ulquiorra Cifer,[683] Ichigo's mask has changed again."
b"The Hollow mask was originally a sign of Ichigo's possession by the his inner Hollow, but after his training with the Visored, it merely indicates he is utilizing his Hollow powers."
b"Power Augmentation: While wearing the mask, Ichigo's Hollow powers supplement his Shinigami powers, giving him a vast increase in both strength and speed.@."
b'Augmented Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d: When Ichigo wears his mask, the power, speed, blast area, force, and size of the Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d becomes drastically augmented, to the point of seriously harming a foe.'
b"When used with his Bankai and Hollow mask in combination, his Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d is stated to be his ultimate attack.[686] Ichigo's tremendous speed lets him to move faster than the Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d itself, allowing him to fire multiple blasts from different directions.[687] Ulquiorra Cifer believes the Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d is Ichigo's strongest attack,[686] comparing it to a Hollow's Cero, particularly a Cero Oscuras.[688] The black Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d was first displayed by Ichigo's inner Hollow, and initially carried the risk of causing his inner Hollow to surface if used too much.[689] With Ichigo's later control over his inner Hollow, this is no longer a problem.[687] With the use of his new mask, he can fire a Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d powerful enough to send Yammy Llargo falling down head first while he was in his much larger and stronger Resurrecci\xc3\xb3n state,[690] and cut a high-rise building in half.[691]@."
b"Enhanced Spiritual Power: While wearing the mask, Ichigo's spiritual power increases drastically.[692] Upon witnessing his enormous Reiatsu, one of the Privaron Espada, Dordoni Alessandro Del Socaccio, described it as amazing.[693] The 4th Espada, Ulquiorra Cifer, stated his Reiatsu was higher than his own (though he also stated it was fluctuating).[694] During Ichigo's fight with Grimmjow, the 3rd Espada, Tier Harribel, note the volume, concentration, and catastrophic nature of his Reiatsu did not seem like that of a Human, but more like that of an Espada.[695] Even S\xc5\x8dsuke Aizen complimented his Reiatsu, stating he had grown.[696] It has been noted multiple times that with the mask on, his spiritual energy changes into something similar to that of a Hollow.[697] Ichigo can use the combined Reiatsu released in his Bankai activation and Hollowfication to launch himself in the air.[698]@."
b"During his second battle against Grimmjow, Ichigo's speed completely overwhelmed the Espada, who was unable to follow Ichigo's movement, and forced him completely on the defensive with his barrage of attacks.[703] His attacks become so fast the opponent cannot even perceive them until after they are hit.[704] He becomes fast enough to outrun his own Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d, allowing him to strike and enhance them, or launch simultaneous attacks at the opponent from different angles.[687]@."
b'The Hollow mask makes Ichigo more ruthless, akin to the battle style of Hollow Ichigo.'
b'Increased Mask Duration: After subjugating his inner Hollow, Ichigo can use his Hollow mask while retaining his personality, but could originally only wear it for four seconds at a time.[713] After training with the Visored, the limit increases to eleven seconds.[714] His time limit and Hollow powers greatly increase during his third battle with Grimmjow.'
b"Grimmjow speculated Ichigo's improvements came from a subconscious need.[715][716] It is unknown if the time limit of his new mask has changed, though the mask began deteriorating immediately after he fired a Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d at S\xc5\x8dsuke Aizen with it on.[717] Once he gained resolve to fight Aizen, the mask was used much longer,[718] but began dispersing again once he lost his composure.[719]@."
b"In his first fight with Ulquiorra, though unseen, it was used to help defend against Ulquiorra's Cero,[721] and again during his most recent confrontation with him, after he enters his released form.[722] Once Ichigo's mask changed in his battle with Yammy Llargo, he noticed his mask felt different, as if it was heavier, and he was unable to re-summon it for a brief period of time.[723] Tensa Zangetsu states the oddities of the new mask come from Ichigo's fear of the Hollow form he took to defeat Ulquiorra, where his sanity was overwhelmed by its power, and he cannot Hollowify properly.[724]@."
b"Merged Hollow Form: After Ichigo learned the truth about the source of his Shinigami powers and reforged his Zanpakut\xc5\x8d, his Hollow and Quincy came into balance with one another; however, should Ichigo's inner Hollow be woken by large amounts of Quincy Reiatsu,[725] this balance will be disrupted, and Ichigo can meld with his inner Hollow,[726] resulting in a powerful transformation.[727] In this form, the left side of Ichigo's face and neck change to resemble the form his inner Hollow took on while fighting Ulquiorra Cifer, as well as his former Hollowfication; his left eye inverts in color with a black sclera and yellow pupil, he has dark marks running down his face and along his neck, and he gains a long, forward-pointing horn on the left side of his head.[728] While in this form, the larger blade of Zangetsu turns white.[729]@."
b"Power Augmentation: As with his Hollow mask, Ichigo's merged Hollow form drastically increases his combat capabilities and overall power.@."
b"Enhanced Speed: While in this form, Ichigo's speed is noticeably enhanced; after entering it behind the protection of Orihime's Santen Kesshun, Ichigo near-instantaneously moved in front of the barrier and a considerable distance away from Orihime, who was unable to fathom how quickly he had gotten there.[730] Shortly afterward, when Yhwach formed his Reishi broadsword in preparation for close-range combat, Ichigo managed to restrain his sword arm while readying an attack before Yhwach could even react.[731]@."
b'Combined Gran Rey Cero-Getsuga Tensho: By using the longer sword of Zangetsu as a substitute second horn and with his blood as a catalyst, Ichigo can fire a Gran Rey Cero; moreover, he can combine it with a Getsuga Tensh\xc5\x8d to create a massive slashing attack powerful enough to wound a Soul King-empowered Yhwach;[734] though the latter quickly brushed it off, he noted that it was nonetheless a potent technique and proof that he had to begin taking Ichigo seriously.[735]@.'
b"Ichigo's imprisonment by Quilge Opie transferred some of Quilge's Reiatsu to Ichigo, which awakened the memories within his Reiatsu left by his mother, who was a Quincy."
b"In the manga, when Aizen slashes Ichigo, the former is shown using his Zanpakut\xc5\x8d to slash Ichigo, leaving the latter missing a large portion of his stomach.[738] Whereas in the anime, Aizen's Zanpakut\xc5\x8d and the missing portion of Ichigo's stomach aren't visible.[739]@."
b"In the manga, Ichigo was shown slicing off Yammy's arm when the former jumped over him, and Yammy then received more grevious injuries from Ichigo during their second clash.[740] In the anime however, Ichigo jumped over Yammy and wasn't shown slicing Yammy's arm, although the latter's arm was still cut off by Ichigo."
b"Ichigo's Zanpakut\xc5\x8d, Zangetsu, was voted the 3rd most popular Zanpakut\xc5\x8d in the Zanpakut\xc5\x8d popularity poll,[747] while his Bankai, Tensa Zangetsu, was ranked 10th.[748]@."
b'Ichigo claims his name comes from ichi for first prize and go for guardian angel,[548] though his father told him his name means "he who protects."[749] Using certain kanji (\xe8\x8b\xba), Ichigo\'s name can mean "strawberry," which led Jidanb\xc5\x8d Ikkanzaka to comment that Ichigo has a cute name[750] and Mashiro Kuna to nickname him "Berry-tan".[751][752] Upon hearing his name, Ikkaku Madarame stated men whose names contain the word ichi are often powerful and talented.[753]@.'
b'When Ichigo takes a new Hollow form in his fight against Ulquiorra, the chapter sketches reveal his Substitute Shinigami Badge is broken.[757]@.'
